$BR
Fill in the blanks to complete an \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) proof showing that 
$BR
\( \displaystyle \lim_{x \to $c}\; x^2 - $a = $L.
\)
$BR
Where it asks for a formula for \(\delta\) use the largest value that will work.
$PAR
Let \{ $eps->menu() \} \( > 0\) be given.  We are interested in values of \(x\) that are close to \($c\) so we may assume that \($cmin < x < $cmax\). Thus
$BR \($c1 < x+$c < $c2\).
$BR Then with \(\delta = \)
\{ans_rule(4)\}\(\epsilon\), and with \(x\) satisfying
$BR
\(|x - \)\{ans_rule(4)\}\(| < \) \{$del->menu()\},
$BR
(after some algebra), we arrive at:
\(|f(x) - \)\{ans_rule(4)\}\(| < \) \{$eps->menu()\},
which is what we wanted to prove.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR

First, we should do some scratch work. 
With \( f(x) = x^2 - $a \), and limiting value $L, we must solve the
inequality:
$BR
\( |f(x) - $L| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x^2 - $a - $L| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x^2 - $b| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x - $c|\cdot|x + $c| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x - $c| < \frac{\epsilon}{|x+$c|} \)
$BR
$BR
Since \(x\) is near \($c\), we can safely assume that \($cmin < x < $cmax\).
Thus
$BR
\( $cmin + $c < x + $c < $cmax + $c \)
$BR
\( $c1 < x + $c < $c2 \)
$BR
\( \frac{1}{$c1} > \frac{1}{x + $c} > \frac{1}{$c2} \)
$BR
\( \frac{\epsilon}{$c1} > \frac{\epsilon}{x + $c} > 
   \frac{\epsilon}{$c2} \)
$BR

This implies we can let \(\delta = \frac{1}{$c2} \epsilon\).  Now reverse
the steps to construct the proof.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Proof of the limit:$EBOLD
$BR
Let \(\epsilon > 0\) be given.  Then with 
\(\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{$c2}\),
and with \(x\) satisfying \(|x - $c| < \delta\), 
$BR
\(|x - $c| < \delta = \frac{1}{$c2}\epsilon < \frac{\epsilon}{x + $c}\)
$BR
\(|x - $c|\cdot |x + $c| < \frac{\epsilon}{x + $c} \cdot |x + $c| \)
$BR
Assuming \(x\) is near \($c\), \(|x+$c|\) is positive and we can
drop the absolute value signs on the right, allowing \( (x + $c) \)
to cancel.
\(|x - $c|\cdot |x + $c| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x^2 - $b| < \epsilon \)
$BR
\( |x^2 - $a - $L| < \epsilon \)
$BR
$BR
The last line shows \( |f(x) - $L| < \epsilon\), which is what
we wanted to prove.
