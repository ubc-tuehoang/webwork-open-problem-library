$PAR
An aquarium 2 m long, 1 m wide, and 1 m deep is full of water.  Find the work (in J) needed to 
pump half of the water out of the aquarium.  Use the fact that the density of water is 
\(1000 \,kg/m^3.\)

Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} J

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We think of the aquarium as made up of infinitely  many "infinitesimal" horizontal slices, with \(x\) the vertical distance an infinitesimal slice of the water is from the top of the pool. $BR
$BR
Each infinitesimal slice at depth \(x\) has area \(A(x) = 2\cdot 1 =2 \; \text{m}^2 \). $BR
The infinitesimal slice has volume \( dV = A(x) dx = 2 dx \; \text{m}^3 \) and since 
\(\text{mass}=\text{density}\times\text{volume} \), the mass of   the slice at \(x\) is 
\( 1000\cdot 2 \, dx= 2000\, dx\).
$BR
$BR
Each slice must be lifted a distance \( h = x \)  meters, and  
\(g = 9.8 \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{sec}^2}. \)
So \(mgh\) for each slice is 
\(9.8(2000)x\, dx \; \text{J} \)
$BR $BR
The sum of lifting all of the slices from the top ( \(x =0\) ) to half of the depth of the water level's  
( \( x = 1/2 \) ) is
\[ \int_0^{1/2} 9.8(2000)x\, dx  = 19600 \int_0^{1/2} x\, dx  
  = 19600 \Big[\frac{x^2}{2} \Big]_0^{1/2} =  2450\; \text{J} \]
