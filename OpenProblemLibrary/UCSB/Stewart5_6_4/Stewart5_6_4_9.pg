$PAR
Suppose that 2 J of work are needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30 cm to a 
length of 42 cm.  How much work (in J) is needed to stretch it from 35 cm to 40 cm?

$PAR
Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} J

ANS(num_cmp("25/24"));

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The work done in moving an object from \(a\) to \(b\) against a force \( f(x) \) is \(\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\).
$BR
Note that since the work is \(2 \) Joules, we must convert all the lengths in meters, so the spring is 
stretched \(0.12\) meters beyond its natural length.
$BR
From Hooke's law, the force to hold a spring \(x\) meters beyond the spring's natural length is
\( f(x) = kx \). Therefore
\[ \begin{array}{rl} \int_0^{0.12} k x \, dx  &= 2  \\
  k \frac{x^2}{2} \Big|_0^{0.12}  &= 2  \\
  k \frac{(0.12)^2}{2}   &= 2  \\
\end{array}
\]
So \( k = \frac{4}{(0.12)^2} = \frac{2500}{9} \frac{\text{Newton}}{\text{meters}} \)
The work required to stretch a spring from 0.05 meters beyond its natural lenght  to 0.1 meters
beyond its natural lenght is
\[ \text{Work} = \int_{0.05}^{0.1} \frac{2500}{9} x \, dx =
  \frac{2500}{9} \frac{x^2}{2} \Big|_{0.05}^{0.1} 
  =\frac{1250}{9} \left((0.1)^2 - (0.05)^2\right) 
  =\frac{25}{24}   \; \text{J}
