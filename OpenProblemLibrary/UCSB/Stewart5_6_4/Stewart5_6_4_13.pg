$PAR
A heavy rope, 50 ft long, weighs 0.5 lb/ft and hangs over the edge of a building 120 ft high.

$PAR
(a) How much work is done (in ft-lb) in pulling the rope to the top of the building?

$PAR
Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} ft-lb

$PAR
(b) How much work is done (in ft-lb) in pulling half the rope to the top of the building?

$PAR
Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} ft-lb

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The work done in pulling the rope to the top of the building is
\[ \text{W} = \int_0^{50} 0.5 x \, dx = \Big[ 0.25 x^2\Big]_0^{50} =
0.25( 50^2) = 625 \; \text{ft-lb} \]
Note that the height of the building does not matter, as long as it is more than 50-ft .

(b) When half the rope is pulled to the top of the building, the work to lift the top half of the rope is 
\[ \text{W}_1 = \int_0^{25} 0.5 x \, dx = \Big[ 0.25 x^2\Big]_0^{25} =
0.25( 25^2) = 156.25 \; \text{ft-lb} \]
The bottom half of the rop is lifted 25 ft and the work needed to accomplish that is
\[ \text{W}_2 = \int_{25}^{50} 0.5 (25) \, dx = 12.5 \Big[ x\Big]_{25}^{50} =
12.5 ( 50-25) =312.5  \; \text{ft-lb} \]
The total work is then
\[ \text{W} = \text{W}_1+\text{W}_2 = 156.25+312.5 = 468.75 \; \text{ft-lb} \]
