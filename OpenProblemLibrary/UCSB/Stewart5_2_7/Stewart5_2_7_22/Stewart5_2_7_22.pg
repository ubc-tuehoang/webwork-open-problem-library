A roast turkey is taken from an oven when its temperature
has reached \(185^{\circ }\)F and is placed on a table in a room where the
temperature is \(75^{\circ }\)F.  
$BR
By measuring the slope of the tangent, estimate the
rate of change of the temperature after an hour.  Your answer
must be within 20${PERCENT} of the correct value.
