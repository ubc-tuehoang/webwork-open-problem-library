$PAR
The boundaries of the shaded region are the \(y\)-axis, the line \(y = 1\), and the curve \(y=\sqrt[4]{x}.\)  Find the area of this region by writing \(x\) as a function of \(y\) and integrating with respect to \(y\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The area enclosed by the two curves is given by  \(A = \int_c^d \left(x_R - x_L\right)dy\) where \(x_R\) is the right boundary as a function of \(y\), and  \(x_L\) is the left boundary as a function of \(y\). 
For our given region, \(x_R = y^4\) and \(x_L = 0\) (the \(y-\)axis),  so  
the area bounded by these two curves is 
\[ \begin{array}{rl}
A  &= {\displaystyle\int}_0^1 \left(x_R - x_L\right) dy\\
  &=  {\displaystyle\int}_0^1  y^4 \, dy\\
  &= \Big[  \frac{1}{5}y^5  \Big]_{0}^{1} \\
  &=\frac{1}{5} 
\end{array}\]
