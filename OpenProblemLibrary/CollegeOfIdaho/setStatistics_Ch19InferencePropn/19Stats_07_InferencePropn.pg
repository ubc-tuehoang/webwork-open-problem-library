#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
$name[$person] wants to determine a $level[$choose] percent confidence interval 
for the true proportion \(p\) of high school students in the area who attend 
their home basketball games. Out of \(n\) randomly selected students $pronoun finds that that exactly half attend their home basketball games.  About how large would \(n\) have to be to get a margin of error less than $m for \(p\)? 
$BR [Use the values for z* from  a z-table or t-table, and round to the smallest integer that works.]
$PAR
\(n \approx \) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
