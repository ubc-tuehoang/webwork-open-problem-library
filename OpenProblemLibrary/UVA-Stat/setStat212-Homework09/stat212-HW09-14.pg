## ERROR TOLERANCES: edit tolerances as necessary 
## Error tolerances should be large enough to enable students to use 
## standard normal instead of t distribution because N>=90. 
## Tolerances may need to be increased if students use tables.  

# tolerance for tstatistic $tstat  

  $tstatTol = .01;  # relative tolerance, fraction of $tstat

# tolerance for t-dist critical value, so 
# t-distribution interval: ($tcrit, infinity), right-hand area < alpha
  
  $tcritTol = .02;  # relative tolerance, fraction of $tcrit

# p-value for t-statistic = area to right of $tstat on t-distribution

  $pvalTol = .005;  # absolute tolerance 

## END OF ERROR TOLERANCES

$PAR
A manufacturer of light bulbs advertises that, on average, 
its long-life bulb will last more than $mu hours.  To test 
this claim,
 a statistician took a random sample of $samp bulbs and 
 measured the amount of time until each bulb burned out.  
 The mean 
 lifetime of the sample of bulbs is $xbar hours and has a 
 standard deviation of $sigma hours.  Can we conclude with $conf$PERCENT 
 confidence that the claim is true?  Fill in the requested information below.

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-inf, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, inf), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-inf, a)U(b, inf).
