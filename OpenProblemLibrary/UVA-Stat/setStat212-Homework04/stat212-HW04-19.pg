Your favorite team is in the World Series.  You have 
assigned a probability of $a1$PERCENT that they will 
win the championship.  Past records indicate that when 
teams win the championship, they win the first game of 
the series $a2$PERCENT of the time.  When they lose the 
championship, they win the first game $a3$PERCENT of the 
time.  The first game is over and your team has lost.  
What is the probability that they will win the World Series?
