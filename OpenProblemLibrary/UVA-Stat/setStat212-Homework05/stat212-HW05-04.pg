$PAR 
The natural remedy echinacea is reputed to boost 
the immune system, which will reduce flu and colds.  
A 6-month study was undertaken to determine whether 
the remedy works.  From this study, the following 
probability distribution of the number of respiratory 
infections per year (X) for echinacea users was produced:

$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(9)\}
\{row("X", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4")\}
\{row("P(X)", $a1, $a2, $a3, $a4, $a5)\}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Find the following probabilities:
$PAR
A.  An echinacea user has more than one infection per year  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  An echinacea user has no infections per year  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C.  An echinacea user has between one and three (inclusive) infections per year  \{ans_rule(15)\}
