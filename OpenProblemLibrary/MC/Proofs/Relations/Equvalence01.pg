BEGIN_TEXT
Order \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof of the statement: 
$BCENTER
$PAR $BR
Suppose \(R\) is a symmetric and transitive relation on \(A\) (i.e. \(A \times A\)) .  
Further suppose that 
for each \(a \in A\) that there exists \(b \in A\) such that \((a,b) \in R\).
$PAR
Show: \(R\) is an equivalence relation.
$ECENTER

$PAR
Quick Hint?
\{ knowlLink("What makes \(R\) an equivalence relation?", value=>'R must be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.') \}
$PAR


$PAR
\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}
