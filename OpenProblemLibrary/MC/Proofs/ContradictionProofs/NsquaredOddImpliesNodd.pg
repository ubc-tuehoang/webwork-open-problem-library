Order \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof by $BBOLD contradiction $EBOLD of the statement:
$PAR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
If the square of an integer is odd then the original integer is also odd.
$EITALIC $ECENTER

$BR
\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}

BEGIN_HINT
To show \(P \implies Q\) by contradiction, start by assuming \(P\) and \( \sim Q\).
