BEGIN_TEXT
Order  \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof of the statement:
$PAR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
a divides b and a divides c implies a divides b+c
$EITALIC $ECENTER

$BR

\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}

END_TEXT

ANS($CorrectProof->cmp);

$showHint = 2;
BEGIN_HINT
You must assume the existence of variables before you can use them
END_HINT

$showHint = 4;
BEGIN_HINT
Consider using the definition of divisibility for $BITALIC each $EITALIC assumption.
