Blink Appliances plans to order microwaves and stoves. Each microwave 
requires $h1 hours to unpack and set up in the storeroom, and each stove 
requires $h2 hours. The storeroom space is limited to $s items.
The budget of the store allows only $h hours of employee time for
unpacking and setup. Microwaves yields a profit of $DOLLAR $c1 each, 
and stoves yields a profit of $DOLLAR $c2 each. How many of each should the store order to
maximize profit?  
$PAR
Number of microwaves to order is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
Number of stoves to order is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The maximum profit is $DOLLAR\{ans_rule(10)\}
