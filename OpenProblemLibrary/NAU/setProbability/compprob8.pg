BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the experiment, called the $BBOLD birthday problem $EBOLD, where 
$BR
our task is to determine the probability that in a group of people of a 
$BR
certain size there are at least two people who have the same birthday 
$BR
(the same month and day of month). Suppose there is a room with $num people 
$BR
in it, find the probability that at least two people have the same birthday.  
Ignore leap years; assume each year has 365 days. 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(90)\}
