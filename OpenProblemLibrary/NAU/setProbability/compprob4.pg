BEGIN_TEXT
Employment data at a large company reveal that $marfrac $PERCENT of the
$BR
workers are married, that $cgfrac $PERCENT are college graduates, and 
$BR
that $refrac of the college graduates are married. 
$BR
What is the probability that a randomly chosen worker is:
$BR
a) neither married nor a college graduate? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT
$BR
b) married but not a college graduate? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT
$BR
c) married or a college graduate? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\}$PERCENT
