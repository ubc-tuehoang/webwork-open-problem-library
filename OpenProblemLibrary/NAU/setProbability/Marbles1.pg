BEGIN_TEXT
Two marbles are drawn randomly one after the other without replacement from a jar that contains $a red marbles,
$b white marbles, and $c yellow marbles. 
Find the probability of the following events.
$BR
(a) A red marble is drawn first followed by a white marble.
$BR
The probability is : \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(b) A white marble is drawn first followed by a white marble.
$BR
The probability is : \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(c) A yellow marble is not drawn at all.
$BR
The probability is : \{ans_rule(10) \}
