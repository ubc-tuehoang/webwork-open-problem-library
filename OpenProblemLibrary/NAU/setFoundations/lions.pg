There are \( n \) very intelligent lions on an uninhabited desert island. 
They are very hungry because they ate everything they could. 
Whenever there is a new food source, the closest lion could choose to quickly eat the available food and fall asleep to digest. 
A sleeping lion becomes prey. 
The lions like their stomachs full but they choose starvation over death.
A helicopter releases an unconscious but alive gazelle onto the island. How many living animals are on the island
on the next day if
