BEGIN_TEXT
Find the point of equilibrium for the following supply and demand equations where 
\(x\) is number of units and \(p\) is the price per unit.
        $PAR
        Demand: \(p = $a - $bstr x\)
$PAR
Supply:  \(p = $c + $dstr x\)
$PAR
Number of units for equilibrium =  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Price per unit at equilibrium = \{ans_rule(40)\}
