TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are taking a road trip in a car without A/C.  The temperture in the car is
$a1 degrees F.  You buy a cold pop at a gas station.  Its initial temperature 
is 45 degrees F.  The pop's temperature reaches 60 degrees F after $c1 
minutes.$BR

Given that 
\[\frac{T-A}{T_0 - A} = e^{-kt} \]

where \(T = \) the temperature of the pop at time t.$BR
\(T_0 = \) the initial temperature of the pop. $BR
\(A = \) the temperature in the car. $BR
\(k = \) a constant that corresponds to the warming rate.$BR
and \(t = \) the length of time that the pop has been warming up.$BR
$BR$BR
How long will it take the pop to reach a temperature of $d1 degrees F?
$BR
It will take \{ans_rule(20) \} minutes.
