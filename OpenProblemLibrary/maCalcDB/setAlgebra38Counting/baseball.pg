There are nine different positions on a baseball team.  If a team has $A 
players how many different line-ups can the team make?  (Assume every player can play every position.)
$PAR
The team can make \{ans_rule(10) \} different line-ups.

$PAR
Baseball games consist of nine innings.  A team wants to change its line-up 
every inning.  If no game goes to extra innings, and a season consists of $B 
games, how many complete seasons can the team play without repeating a line-up?
$PAR
The team can play \{ans_rule(10) \} complete seasons without repeating 
a line-up.  (Your answer should be an integer.)
