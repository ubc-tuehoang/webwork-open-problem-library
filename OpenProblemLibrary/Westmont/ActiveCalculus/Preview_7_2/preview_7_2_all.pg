BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the differential equation \(\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2}\).
$PAR

Suppose that \(y(t)\) is a solution to this differential equation corresponding to the initial value \(y(0) = 1\). On the graph of \(y\) versus \(t\), what is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point \((0,1)\)?
$BR
Slope = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$PAR

Suppose (instead) that \(y(t)\) is a solution to this differential equation corresponding to the initial value \(y(0) = 5\). On the graph of \(y\) versus \(t\), what is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point \((0,5)\)?

Slope = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The differential equation \(\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2}\) gives the slope of the solution curve as a function of time, so the \(t\)-coordinate of any point on the solution curve determines the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.
