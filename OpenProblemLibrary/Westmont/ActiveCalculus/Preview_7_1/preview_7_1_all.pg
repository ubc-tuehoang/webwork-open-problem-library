BEGIN_TEXT
The position of an object moving along a line is given by the
function \(s(t)\), where \(s\) is measured in feet and \(t\) in seconds.  We
determine that the velocity is \(v(t) = 4t + 1\) feet per second.
$PAR

How much does the position change over the time interval \([0,4]\)?
$BR
Change in position = \{ans_rule(10)\} feet 
$PAR

Suppose you are told that the object's initial position \(s(0) = 7\).  Determine \(s(2)\), the object's position \(2\) seconds later. $BR
\(s(2) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR

If you are told instead that the object's initial position is \(s(0) = 3\), what is \(s(2)\)? $BR
\(s(2) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR

If we only know the velocity \(v(t)=4t+1\) (but not the initial position), which of the following could be the position function? $BR
\{ $mc -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc -> print_a() \}

$PAR

\{ $mc2->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc2->print_a() \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The change in position is given by the integral \(\int_0^4 4t+1 \, dt = 36\) feet. Therefore, the position function will be \(s_0+ 2t^2+t\), where \(s_0\) is the initial velocity.
