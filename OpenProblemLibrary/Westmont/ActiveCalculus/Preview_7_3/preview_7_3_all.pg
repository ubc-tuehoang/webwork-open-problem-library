SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Given a value of \(y\), we can compute the slope of the tangent line using the formula for \(dy/dt\). So given a value of \(t\), we must first compute (or approximate) a value of \(y\). When \(t=0\), the initial condition tells us that \(y=0\), so the corresponding slope is \(\frac{1}{2}(0+1) = \frac{1}{2}\) and the equation of the tangent line is \(y=\frac{1}{2}t\). Now when \(t=2\), we can use this tangent line equation to approximate \(y \approx \frac{1}{2}\cdot 2 =1\), and then we can use this approximate value of \(y\) to approximate the slope to be \(\frac{1}{2}(1+1)\). In point-slope form, the tangent line to the solution curve at \(t=2\) is approximately \(y\approx 1(t-2)+1\), and so \(y(4) \approx 3\).
