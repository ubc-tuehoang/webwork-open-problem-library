Explain the distinction between the following two scenarios.
$PAR
$BITALIC Scenario A: $EITALIC A professor chooses three students to work together on
         a problem.
$PAR
$BITALIC Scenario B: $EITALIC A professor asks three questions in sequence, and each
          time calls on a student to answer.
$PAR
How are the professor's choices constrained in each scenario?  Compare and
contrast.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. Sample answer:
In Scenario A, the professor must choose three different students, but in Scenario B, the professor may call on the same student more than once, so it is possible that fewer than three students get called on. So there are fewer constraints in the Scenario B. Also, in B, order matters, but in A, there is no order imposed on the group.
