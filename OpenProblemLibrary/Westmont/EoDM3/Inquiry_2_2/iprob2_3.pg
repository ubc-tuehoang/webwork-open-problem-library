BEGIN_TEXT
    A certain discrete mathematics class consists of \($totstud\) students.  Of these, \($mmaj\) plan to major in mathematics and \($csmaj\) plan to major in computer science.   Five students are not planning to major in either subject.  How many students are planning to major in both subjects?  (Be prepared to explain your reasoning with some sort of diagram.)
$BR
Number of students majoring in both = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
There are \($totstud-5\) students majoring in either math only, CS only, or both math and CS. Since there are \($mmaj\) math majors and \($csmaj\) CS majors, and since \($mmaj+$csmaj\) is \($intstud\) more than \($totstud-5\), there must be \($intstud\) majoring in both.
