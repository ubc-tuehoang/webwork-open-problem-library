BEGIN_TEXT
    Let \(E\) be the set of even integers and let \(O\) be the set of odd integers.
    Suppose that a computer is programmed to input a sequence of elements of
    \(E\) and output a sequence of elements of \(O\) according to some rule. You
    run a test of this program using \(12, 6, 8, 10, 2\) as input, and the
    computer outputs \(81, 9, 25, 49, 1\).  What rule does the computer appear to
    be using?
