BEGIN_TEXT
$BBOLD Definition. $EBOLD 
An $BITALIC f-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph where each vertex has outdegree 1. That is, each vertex has exactly one arrow coming out of it.  
$PAR
On a separate sheet of paper, draw an example of an f-graph with at least five vertices.  Invent a
shorthand notation that encodes all the information needed to reconstruct
the graph, and describe the graph below using your notation.
