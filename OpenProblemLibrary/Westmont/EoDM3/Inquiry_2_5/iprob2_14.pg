BEGIN_TEXT
    A $BITALIC round robin $EITALIC is a type of tournament where each participant plays
    every other participant exactly once.  
    Under what conditions will a round robin tournament give a well-defined 
    ranking of all tournament participants? Give an example with at least four
    participants.

Answers may vary. Sample answer:
There will be a well-defined ranking when all players have a different number of wins. Suppose that there are no ties. For \(n\) players to each have a different number of wins, the numbers of wins must include all the numbers in the sequence \(0,1,2, \ldots, n-1\). With four players \(A,B,C,D\), we could have \(A >B\) (\(A\) beats \(B\)), \(A>C\), \(A>D\), so \(A\) has 3 wins. Then \(B>C\) and \(B>D\) and \(C>D\), so \(B,C,D\) have 2, 1, 0 wins, respectively. The graph of this relation has no directed circuits.
