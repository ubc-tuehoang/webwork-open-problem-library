Buttercup knows whether or not Westley is lying. She promises that if Westley
is lying, she will give you a cookie. Buttercup always keeps her promises.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
If Westley is lying, she must give you a cookie, but if he isn't lying, she
isn't obligated to give you one, though she may give you one anyway. Therefore,
if you don't get a cookie, Westley must not be lying, but if you do get one,
you can't be sure about Westley's veracity.
