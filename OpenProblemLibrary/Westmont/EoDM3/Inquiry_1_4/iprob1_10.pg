$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
This is a bit of a trick question. First of all, it requires that we agree upon
a definition for even and odd number. It also requires some axioms from number
theory that we probably haven't discussed.  The problem should illustrate the
difficulty of proceeding without definitions and axioms. After this difficulty
is discussed, students could be encouraged to read the discussion in [H],
Section 1.4.1.
