BEGIN_TEXT
Recall that a $BITALIC prime number $EITALIC is a natural number \(n\) such
that \(n>1\) and \(n\) has no divisors other than \(n\) and \(1\). Prove or
disprove: Every prime number greater than \(3\) is the sum of two prime
numbers.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Counterexample: 11 is prime, but 11 can't be the sum of two odd numbers, since
it is odd, so if it were to be the sum of two prime numbers it must be the sum
of 2 and an odd prime number, but \(11-2=9\), which isn't prime.
