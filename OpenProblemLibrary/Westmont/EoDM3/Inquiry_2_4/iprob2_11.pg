TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_TEXT
    On a separate sheet of paper, draw a directed graph whose vertices represent the integers
    \(1,2,\ldots, 7\),
    where there is an edge from vertex \(n\) to vertex \(m\) iff \(m-n\) is even.
    What properties do you notice about this graph? Would these properties
    remain if the graph were constructed using a longer list of integers?

Answers may vary. Sample answer:
Every edge has a corresponding edge in the other direction, and all the even numbers are in one component while all the odd numbers are in another.
