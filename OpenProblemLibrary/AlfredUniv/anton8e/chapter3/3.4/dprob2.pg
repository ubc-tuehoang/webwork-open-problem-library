## Function Definition
$T = Real(random(20,90));
$Tprime = Real(non_zero_random(-10,10));
$V = Real(random(5,20));
$Vprime = Real(non_zero_random(-10,10));
$t = Real(random(5,10));
$dPdt = NumberWithUnits("($Tprime*$V - $T*$Vprime)/($V^2)","Pa/s");

BEGIN_TEXT
The pressure on an object B is proportional to the temperature measured in degrees Kelvin (abbreviated \({}^{\circ}K\)), and inversely proportional to the volume: 
\[P=\frac{T}{V}\] 
with the pressure P measured in Pascals (abbreviated Pa). In this case the temperature and the volume both depend on time, hence so the does the pressure: \(P(t) = \frac{T(t)}{V(t)}\). At time \(t=$t\) seconds the temperature of an object is \($T {}^{\circ}K\) and increasing at a rate of \($Tprime \frac{{}^{\circ}K}{s}\) and the volume is \($V m^3\) and increasing at the rate \($Vprime \frac{m^3}{s}\).  
$PAR
Using the quotient rule, the pressure on the object is changing at the rate
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
When entering units use Pa for Pascals, K for degrees Kelvin, m for meters, s for seconds.
