$PAR
For \(k > 0\), the PDE \[k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\]
is separable, so we follow the Sturm-Liouville procedure and look for basic solutions of the form \(u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\)
$BR
Using this basic solution the PDE can be rewritten,  collecting \(X\) and its derivatives on the left and \(k\) and \(T\) and its derivatives on the right, as  
$BR
\{$Xdiff1->ans_rule\} = \{$Tdiff1->ans_rule\} = \(-\lambda\)
$PAR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of \(X\) is written as \(X^\prime\). Do NOT use \(X^\prime(x)\)
$PAR
Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated: (Type the word lambda to represent the Greek letter \(\lambda\).)
$BR
DE in X: \{$Xdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$PAR
DE in T: \{$Tdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$PAR
In each case the general solution in \(X\) is written with constants \(a\) and \(b\) and the general solution in \(T\) is written with constant \(c\).  (Use the word alpha to represent the Greek letter \(\alpha\).)  
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: $EBOLD \(\lambda = 0\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xequal->ans_rule(70)\} with \(X(0)=a\) and \(X'(0)=b\).
$BR
\(T(t) = \) \{$Tequal->ans_rule(70)\} with \(T(0)=c\).
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uequal->ans_rule(70)\} 
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2: $EBOLD \(\lambda = -\alpha^2\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xless->ans_rule(70)\} with \(X(0)=a\) and \(X'(0)=\alpha b\).
$BR
\(T(t) = \) \{$Tless->ans_rule(70)\} with \(T(0)=c\). 
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
$BBOLD Case 3: $EBOLD \(\lambda = \alpha^2 \)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xgreater->ans_rule(70)\} with \(X(0)=a\) and \(X'(0)=\alpha b\).
$BR
\(T(t) = \) \{$Tgreater->ans_rule(70)\} with \(T(0)=c\).
$BR
\(u = \) \{$ugreater->ans_rule(70)\}
$PAR
In each case solutions to the original PDE are obtained by summing the basic solutions, choosing the constants to make the sum satisfy boundary conditions.
