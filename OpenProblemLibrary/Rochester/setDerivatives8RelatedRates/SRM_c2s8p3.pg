Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of \(!{$flowRate:%5.1f}
\)
cubic centimeters per min at the same time that water is being pumped
 into the tank at
a constant rate.  The tank has height \(!{$height:%5.1f}\) meters and the diameter at
the top is \(!{$diameter:%5.1f}\) meters.  If the water level is rising at a rate of
\( !{$levelRate:%5.1f}\) centimeters per minute when the height of the water is
\(! {$level:%5.1f}\) meters,
find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic
centimeters per minute.

$BR
Note: Let "R" be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in.  Then you know that if \(V\) is volume of water, \(\frac{dV}{dt}=R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\).  Use geometry (similar triangles?) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius r and height h is given by \(\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\).

$BR
If \( R\) is  the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in and  \(V\) is volume of 
water, then  \(\frac{dV}{dt}=R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\), where 
\( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\) is the volume at time \(t \). 
$BR
By similar triangles, \( \displaystyle  \frac{r}{$B}= \frac{h}{$D} \).
So \( r = $k h \).
$BR
Substituting this expression for \(r\) into the formula for the volume, we get
\[ V =  \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h =   \frac{1}{3} \pi \left($k h\right)^2 h = $k1 \pi h^3  \]
Differentiating with respect to \(t\), gives
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} =  $k2 \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]
When \( h = $H \), \(\frac{dh}{dt} = $levelRate \), so 
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} =  $k2 \pi ($H)^2 $levelRate  = R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\]
Solving for \(R\) gives:  \[ R = !{$flowRate:%5.1f} +  $k2 \pi ($H)^2 $levelRate  \approx  !{$ans:%5.1f}
\;  \text{cm}^3\text{/min}\]
