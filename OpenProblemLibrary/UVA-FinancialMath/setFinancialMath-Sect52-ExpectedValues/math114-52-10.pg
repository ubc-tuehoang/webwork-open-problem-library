TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

In the Old York State Lottery the probability of winning $a dollars is $p1 percent, 
the probability of winning $b dollars is $p2 percent, and the probability of 
winning $c dollars is $p3 percent.  If each ticket costs one dollar and $n million (i.e. ${m})
tickets will be purchased, what is the total expected profit for Old York?  
(Note: total expected profit = expected profit per ticket times the number of tickets)

$BR

Answer =  \{ans_rule(25) \} dollars.
