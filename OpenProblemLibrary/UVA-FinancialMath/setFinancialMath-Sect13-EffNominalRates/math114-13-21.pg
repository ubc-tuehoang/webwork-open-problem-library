TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You deposit $b dollars into an account paying a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible semiannually.  At the same time, your friend deposits $a
dollars into an account paying a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent convertible
quarterly.  How many years will it take for your account balances to be equal?  
(Assume compound interest at all times.)
