Suppose that you loan $a dollars to a friend today, and $b dollars
to the same friend a year from now.  In two years, you receive $c
dollars repayment for both loans.  What are the possible effective rates of
interest on this transaction?  (If you find more than one, list them separated
by commas.)
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(40) \} percent.
