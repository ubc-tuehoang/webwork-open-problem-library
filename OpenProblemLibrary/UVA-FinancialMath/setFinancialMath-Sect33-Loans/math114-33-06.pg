Robert is repaying a debt with $n annual payments of $b dollars
each, the first coming a year from now.  At the end of the 4th
year, he makes an extra payment of $b2 dollars.  He then shortens
his remaining payment period by 2 years, and makes level payments
over the remaining time.  If the effective rate of interest is $ip
percent, how large is his new annual payment?
