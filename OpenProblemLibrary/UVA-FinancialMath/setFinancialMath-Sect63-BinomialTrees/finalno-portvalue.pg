TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that a stock price is currently $s dollars,
and it is known that three months from now, the price will be either
$su dollars or $sd dollars.  Suppose further that you
set up a riskless portfolio that consists of buying 1 European put
option with a strike price of $str dollars, and buying an appropriate 
number of shares of the stock.  Assuming that no arbitrage opportunities 
exist and a risk-free interest rate of $rp percent, 
what is the value of the riskless portfolio three months
before the exercise date?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
