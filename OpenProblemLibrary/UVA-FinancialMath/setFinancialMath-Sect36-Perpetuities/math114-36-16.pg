TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that a perpetuity makes payments every two years, with the first coming three years from now.  The first payment is $p dollars, and each payment thereafter is $jp percent larger than
the one before it.  If the effective rate of interest is $ip percent, 
what is the present value of the perpetuity?

$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

$ans = $p/($i-$j)*(1+$ie)**(-1);
