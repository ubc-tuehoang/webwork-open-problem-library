TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Gonzo borrows $a dollars from Kermit at an effective rate of $ip percent, and
agrees to make $n equal annual payments (the first a year from now) to repay the
loan.  Immediately after Gonzo makes the ${t}th payment, Kermit sells the loan
to Fozzie.  If Kermit's total yield rate (on both the original loan and the sale to Fozzie)
is $jp percent effective, 
how much did Fozzie pay for the loan?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

$ans = ($a - $P*$at)*(1+$j)**$t;
