TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

TJ has borrowed $a dollars at a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible monthly.  He has agreed to repay the loan with equal monthly
payments for $t years, the first coming one month after the loan is made.  After making
the 30th payment, he makes a deal with the lender where he'll pay off the
balance owed on the loan with $n more equal monthly payments.  The lender agrees, 
provided that the yield rate on the remaining payments
is $kp percent convertible monthly.  Under these new terms, how large are TJ's
new monthly payments?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
