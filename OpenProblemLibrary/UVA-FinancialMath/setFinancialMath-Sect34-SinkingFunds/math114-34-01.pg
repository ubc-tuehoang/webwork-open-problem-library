TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Richard borrows $a dollars.  He agrees to make annual interest payments on 
the loan, and will build up a sinking fund with annual deposits to repay 
the principal with a single payment $n years 
from now. If the interest rate on the loan is
$ip percent, and the interest paid on the sinking fund is $jp percent, both
effective, what is Richard's total outlay?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $sdep + $intpay;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f') );
