TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Your grandmother gives you $a dollars for your birthday, which you 
invest in a mutual fund on January 1.  On June 1, your fund balance 
is $b dollars, and you then deposit $c dollars (which you received 
for your high school graduation).  On the following January 1, 
you calculate that your dollar-weighted rate of return for the year was $ip percent. 
What was your time-weighted rate of return for the year? 


$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.

$ans = 100*(($b/$a)*($B/($b+$c)) - 1);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .001) );
