TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that you buy a share of stock for $K2 dollars.  In order to hedge 
your investment, you decide to also buy 2 put options and sell 1 call option on the same stock.  Each of the two puts costs $c1 dollars and has a strike price of $K1 dollars.
The call costs $c3 dollars, and has a strike price of $K3 dollars.
Find (if it exists) the minimum possible profit for your portfolio 
on the exercise date. If there is no minimum, then write "None" for your answer.  (Note: your portfolio contains options and a share of stock.)$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
