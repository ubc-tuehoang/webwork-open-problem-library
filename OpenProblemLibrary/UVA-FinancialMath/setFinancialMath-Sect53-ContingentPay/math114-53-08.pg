TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

An investment will pay annual 
payments of $a dollars, the first coming a year from now.  The 
expected yield rate is $yp percent effective.  Each year there is a $dp 
percent chance that a payment will not be made, and once a payment is missed 
no further payments are made.  If the investment is worth $e dollars now, 
how many payments would be made if all payments were received?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} payments.
