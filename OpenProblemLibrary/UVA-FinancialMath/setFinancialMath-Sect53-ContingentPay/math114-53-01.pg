TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that your cousin Ralph wants to borrow $n dollars, with
the loan to be repaid in a single payment a year from now.  You
want an expected yield rate of $yp percent and figure that there is a $dp percent
chance he won't repay you.  How much should he be asked to repay a year from
now?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $n*(1+$y)/(1-$d);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.01) );
