Barry presently has $b million dollars in an account paying a nominal rate
of $ip percent convertible quarterly.  He plans to start making quarterly
withdrawals from the account when he retires, the first coming in exactly $y years.

the account) and the withdrawals will increase by $jp percent from one to
the next, how large is his first withdrawal?
