# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The following scenario describes the temperature \(u\) of a rod at position \(x\) and time \(t\).
$PAR
Consider the equation \( u_t = u_{xx} \), \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( t > 0 \),
with boundary conditions \( u(0,t) = 0 , u(1,t) = 0 \).
Suppose
$BR
\( u(x,0) =
\sin(n \pi x) \)
$BR
$BR
That is, an input data of frequency \(n\).  Suppose \(V(t)\) denotes the maximum
variation of temperature on the rod at time \(t\), that is, the maximum temperature
minus the lowest temperature.  We are interested as to what happens as \(n\)
grows.

# Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:$PAR
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}
$BR
$BR
The solution will be \( e^{-n^2\pi^2 t} \sin(n\pi x) \).
The min and max of \( \sin \) is \(\pm 1\), so 
\( V(t) = 2 e^{-n^2\pi^2 t} \).  \(V(t)\) goes to zero, and
as \(n\) grows \(V(t)\) goes to zero faster.
