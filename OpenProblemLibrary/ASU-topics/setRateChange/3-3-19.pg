Suppose that an object moves along the \(y\)-axis
so that its location is \( y = x^2 ? {$a}x\) at time
\(x\).  (Here \(y\) is in meters and \(x\) is in seconds.) 
$PAR
(A) Find the average velocity (the average rate of change
of \(y\) with respect to \(x\)) for \(x\) changing from $b to $c
seconds.  Don't forget to include \{helpLink("units")\} in all your answers. 
$BR
Average velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\} 
$PAR
(B) Find the average velocity for \(x\) changing from \($d\) to
\($d + h\) seconds.
$BR
Average velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
$BR
(C) Find the instantaneous velocity at \(x = $d\) seconds .
$BR
Instantaneous velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\}
