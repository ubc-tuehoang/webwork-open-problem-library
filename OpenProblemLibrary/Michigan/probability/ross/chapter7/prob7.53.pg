BEGIN_TEXT

In a popular tale of wizards and witches, a group of them finds themselves
in a room with doors which change position, making it impossible
to determine which door is which when the room is entered or reentered.
Suppose that there are $num_doors doors in the room.  One door leads out
of the building after $esc_hours hours of travel.  The second and third
doors return to the room after $ret1_hours and $ret2_hours hours of
travel, respectively.  $fourthtext

$PAR
If the probabilities with which the group selects the $num doors are $p1, 
$p2, $prest, what is the expected number of hours before 
the group exits the building?

$PAR
\(E[\mbox{Number of hours}] = \) \{ $en->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

We find the expected number of hours by conditioning on the door
selected.  Thus, with \(N\) as the number of hours and \(X_j\) being
the event that the \(j\)th door is selected, we have
\[ E[N] = E[N|X_1] P(X_1) + E[N|X_2] P(X_2) + E[N|X_3] P(X_3) $e4. \]
Then, for all but \( E[N|X_1] = $esc_hours \), the expected number of
hours for leaving the building is \(E[N]\) plus the time to return to
the room, so that \(E[N|X_2] = $ret1_hours + E[N]\), $thirdand
\(E[N|X_3] = $ret2_hours + E[N]\)$e4a.  Thus we have
\[ E[N] = ($esc_hours)($p1) + ($ret1_hours)($p2) + ($ret2_hours)($p3)
$r4hours + ($p2 + $p3 $ap4)E[N]. \]
Solving for \(E[N]\), we get \(E[N] = $en\).
