BEGIN_TEXT

Consider the problem of approximating a continuous analog signal \(X\)
with a discrete digital signal \(Y\).  To do this, we may divide the
range of \(X\) into discrete intervals, \([a_0,a_1)\), \([a_1,a_2)\), etc.
Then, if \(X\) takes on a value in the interval \([a_0,a_1)\), we assign
the value \(y_1\) to the discrete signal (predictor) \(Y\), and so on for
the other intervals.
$PAR
Suppose that \(X\) is distributed on \([0,1]\) according to the PDF
\(f(x) = $md x + $b\).  If we discretize by picking \(a_0 = 0\),
\(a_1 = 1/2\) and \(a_2 = 1\), how should we pick \(y_1\) and \(y_2\)
to generate the best predictor of \(X\) (that is, to minimize
\(E[(X-Y)^2]\)?
$PAR
\( y_1 = \) \{ $y1->ans_rule() \} $BR
\( y_2 = \) \{ $y2->ans_rule() \}
$PAR
In this case, what is the expectation? $BR
\( E[(X-Y)^2] = \) \{ $exp->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

We want to minimize \(E[(X-Y)^2]\), which we can calculate by
conditioning on the interval in which the value of \(X\) falls.
Note that \(P(X\in [0,1/2)) = \int_0^{1/2} $md x + $b\,dx = $p1\)
and similarly \(P(X\in [1/2,1)) = $p2\).  Thus
\[ E[(X-Y)^2] = $p1\int_0^{1/2} (x - y_1)^2 \frac{($md x + $b)}{$p1}\, dx +
  $p2 \int_{1/2}^1 (x - y_2)^2 \frac{($md x + $b)}{$p2}\,dx. \]
Evaluating the first integral by expanding and collecting terms in
\(x\), we have
\[ \int_0^{1/2} (x - y_1)^2 ($md x + $b)\, dx = $i1y2\, y_1^2 -
$i1y1\, y_1 + $i1y0, \]
and the second integral similarly becomes
\[ \int_{1/2}^{1} (x - y_2)^2 ($md x + $b)\, dx = $i2y2\, y_2^2 -
$i2y1\, y_2 + $i2y0. \]
$PAR
To minimize these, we seek to pick \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) so the expectation
is minimized; in that both integrals are upward opening positive-valued
parabolas in \(y_1\) and \(y_2\), this will occur when each is individually
minimized.  Taking the derivative of each with respect to the \(y\)-value
and setting to zero, we find \(y_1 = $y1\) and \(y_2 = $y2\).
$PAR
Then the expected value is given by the expression above, plugging in
these values for \(y_1\) and \(y_2\); we find
\( E[(X-Y)^2] = $exp \).
