BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose we have two weighted coins, one of which comes up heads
with probability $p1, and the other of which comes up heads with
probability $p2.  Unfortunately, the coins are otherwise identical,
and we have lost track of which is which.  Suppose we flip a
randomly chosen coin $nt times and let \(N\) be the random variable
giving the number of heads seen.  If in the first $n1 flips we see
$nh heads, what is the conditional expected number of heads in the
$nt flips?
$PAR
\( E[N|\mbox{$nh of first $n1 are H}] = \) \{ $en->ans_rule() \}

$en1c1 = $n2*$p1;
$en1c2 = $n2*$p2;
$p1c = 1 - $p1;
$pc1nhn1 = ($p1**$nh)*$p1c;
$p2c = 1 - $p2;
$pc2nhn1 = ($p2**$nh)*$p2c;
$pc1gat = $pc1nhn1/(.5*($pc1nhn1 + $pc2nhn2));

BEGIN_SOLUTION

It may be easiest to condition the expectation on the coin chosen,
and then calculate the conditional probability of which coin was
chosen given that we had $nh heads in the first $n1 rolls.  Let
\(N_1\) be the random variable giving the number of heads in the
remaining $n2 rolls.
\[ E[N] = 2 + E[N_1|\mbox{ coin 1}] P(\mbox{coin 1}| \mbox{ $nh of $n1 H}) +
E[N_1|\mbox{ coin 2}] P(\mbox{coin 2 }| \mbox{ $nh of $n1 H}). \]
Clearly \(E[N_1|\mbox{ coin 1}] = ($n2)($p1) = $en1c1\) and
\(E[N_1|\mbox{ coin 2}] = ($n2)($p2) = $en1c2\).  Then
\[ P(\mbox{coin 1 }|\mbox{ $nh of $n1 H}) =
\frac{P(\mbox{coin 1 and $nh of $n1 H})}{P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H})}. \]
The numerator is clearly \( $p1^$nh $p1c = $pc1nhn1 \).  The denominator
is
\[ P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H}) =
   P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H }|\mbox{ coin 1})P(\mbox{coin 1}) +
   P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H }|\mbox{ coin 2})P(\mbox{coin 2}). \]
If we pick the coin at random,
\( P(\mbox{coin 1}) = P(\mbox{coin 2}) = 0.5 \).  Then
\( P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H }|\mbox{ coin 1}) = $p1^$nh $p1c = $pc1nhn1 \) and
\( P(\mbox{$nh of $n1 H }|\mbox{ coin 2}) = $p2^$nh $p2c = $pc2nhn1 \).
Thus
\[ P(\mbox{coin 1 }|\mbox{ $nh of $n1 H})) =
\frac{$pc1nhn1}{($pc1nhn1)(.5) + ($pc2nhn1)(.5)} = $pc1gat, \]
and
\[ E[N] = 2 + $en1c1 ($pc1gat) + $cn1c2 (1 - $pc1gat) = $en. \]
