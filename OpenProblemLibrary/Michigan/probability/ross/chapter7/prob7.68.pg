The number of accidents that a person has in a given year is a Poisson
random variable with mean \(\lambda\).  However, we may suppose that
the rate \(\lambda\) depends on the person or portion of the population.
Suppose that \(\lambda = $l1\) for $per1 percent of the population, and
\(\lambda = $l2\) for the other $per2 percent.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
If a person is chosen at random, what is the probability that s/he will
have zero accidents in a certain year?
$BR
\( P(\mbox{no accidents}) = \) \{ $pnone->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
If a person is chosen at random, what is the probability that s/he will
have $n accidents in a certain year?
$BR
\( P(\mbox{$n accidents}) = \) \{ $pnum->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
What is the conditional probability that the person will have $n
accidents in a given year, given that s/he had none in the preceding
year?
$BR
\( P(\mbox{$n accidents|none preceding}) = \) \{ $pcond->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
We calculate the probability by conditioning on the population
group.
\[ P = P(\mbox{none }|\mbox{ group 1})\cdot $p1 +
P(\mbox{none }|\mbox{ group 2})\cdot $p2 = $p1 e^{-$l1} + $p2 e^{-$l2}
\approx $pnone. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
We can calculate this probability in the same manner as above, finding
\[ P = $p1 e^{-$l1}\frac{$l1^$n}{$n!} + $p2 e^{-$l2}\frac{$l2^$n}{$n!}
\approx $pnum. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Knowing that a person had no accidents in the previous year allows us
to make a better calculation of the probability that s/he is in the first
or second group.  We have
\[ P(\mbox{group 1 }|\mbox{ none}) =
\frac{P(\mbox{group 1 and none})}{P(\mbox{none})} =
\frac{$p1 e^{-$l1}}{$p1 e^{-$l1} + $p2 e^{-$l2}} \approx $pg1. \]
Thus
\[ P(\mbox{$n }|\mbox{ none in prev}) =
($pg1)(e^{-$l1} \frac{$l1^$n}{$n!}) + (1 - $pg1)(e^{-$l2}\frac{$l2^$n}{$n!})
\approx $pcond. \]
