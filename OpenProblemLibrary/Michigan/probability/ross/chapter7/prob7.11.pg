BEGIN_TEXT

Consider $n independent flips of a coin having probability
$p of landing on heads.  We say that a changeover occurs when
an outcome is different from the one preceding it.  Find the
expected number of changeovers.
$BR
\( E[\mbox{changeovers}] = \) \{ $ex->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Let \(X_j\) be one if there is a changeover on the \(j\)th
flip, and zero otherwise.  Then, if \(N\) is the number of
changeovers,
\[E[N] = E[\sum\limits_{j=2}^{n} X_j] = \sum\limits_{j=2}^{n} E[X_j]
 = $n1 E[X_j].\]
We note that \(E[X_j] = 0\cdot P\lbrace X_j = 0\rbrace +
1\cdot P\lbrace X_j = 1\rbrace = P\lbrace X_j = 1\rbrace\).  This
probability can be calculated by conditioning on the \(j-1\)st flip:
\[\begin{aligned} P\lbrace X_j = 1\rbrace &=
P\lbrace X_j = 1| j-1 = H\rbrace P(j-1 = H) +
P\lbrace X_j = 1| j-1 = T\rbrace P(j-1 = T)\\
&= P(j = T)P(j-1 = H) + P(j = H)P(j-1 = T) \\
&= ($p1)($p) + ($p)($p1) = $twopp1.
\end{aligned} \]
Thus \( E[N] = ($n1)($twopp1) = $ex \).
