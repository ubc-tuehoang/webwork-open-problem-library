BEGIN_TEXT

For a group of $n people, assuming that each person is equally likely
to have a birthday on each of 365 days in the year, compute
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The expected number of days of the year that are birthdays of exactly
$p people: $BR
\( E[\mbox{days with $p birthdays}] = \) \{ $e1->ans_rule() \}
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The expected number of distinct birthdays: $BR
\( E[\mbox{distinct birthdays}] = \) \{ $e2->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

For both parts, we assume the probability of a person having a birthday
on the \(i\)th day of the year is \(p = 1/365\).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Let \(I_j\) be an indicator variable for the \(j\)th day of the year,
with \(I_j = 1\) if that day has exactly $p birthdays, and \(I_j = 0\)
otherwise.  Then the probability that there are $p birthdays on the
day is binomial:
\[ P\lbrace I_j = 1\rbrace = \binom{$n}{$p} \left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^$p
\left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^{$nmp}. \]
With \(X\) as the number of days with \(p\) birthdays,
\[ E[X] = E[\sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} I_j] = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} E[I_j]
  = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} P\lbrace I_j = 1\rbrace =
  365 P\lbrace I_j = 1\rbrace \approx $e1. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
To find the number of distinct birthdays, we want to find the number of
days in the year that have at least one birthday.  Let \(Y_j = 1\) if the
\(j\)th day of the year has at least one birthday, and \(Y_j = 0\)
otherwise.  Then
\(P\lbrace Y_j = 0\rbrace = P(\mbox{none of $n people have birthday j})\).
This is just \(P\lbrace Y_j = 0\rbrace = (\frac{364}{365})^{$n}\), so that
\(P\lbrace Y_j = 1\rbrace = 1 - (\frac{364}{365})^{$n}\).  Then, similarly
to above, with \(X\) as the number of days with a birthday, we have
\[ E[X] = E[\sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} Y_j] = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} E[Y_j]
  = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{365} P\lbrace Y_j = 1\rbrace =
  365 P\lbrace Y_j = 1\rbrace \approx $e2. \]
