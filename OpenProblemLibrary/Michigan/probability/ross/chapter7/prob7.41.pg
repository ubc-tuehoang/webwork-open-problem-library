A pond contains $nf fish, of which $nc are carp.  If $nt fish are caught
from the lake, what are the mean and variance of the number of carp among
those $nt?
$BR
Mean = \{ $mu->ans_rule() \} (round to the nearest integer fish)
$BR
Variance = \{ $var->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Note that the number of fish caught is just a hypergeometric random
variable; we can therefore use the (known) mean and variance of a
hypergeometric random variable with parameters \(m = $nc\), \(N = $nf\)
and \(n = $nt\) to find the solution to the problem.  Alternately, we
can use indicator variables, too, as in the following.
$PAR

We can find the mean by thinking about each carp.  Let \(I_j\) be
an indicator variable that is 1 if the carp is caught, and 0 otherwise.
Then
\[ P\lbrace I_j = 0\rbrace = \frac{$nfm1}{$nf}\cdot\frac{$nfm2}{$nfm1}\cdots
\frac{$nfmnt}{$nfmntp1} = \frac{$nfmnt}{$nf} = \frac{$pr0n}{$pr0d}. \]
With \(X\) as the number of carp we catch, we have
\[ E[X] = E[\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} I_j] =
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} E[I_j] =
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} P\lbrace I_j = 1\rbrace =
$nc( 1 - \frac{$pr0n}{$pr0d} ) = $mu \approx $murd. \]
$PAR

Then, to find the variance, we note that
\[\mbox{Var}(X) = \mbox{Var}(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} I_j) =
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} \mbox{Var}(I_j) +
2\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{j-1}\mbox{Cov}(I_j,I_K).\]
The variance of each \(I_j\) is
\[ \mbox{Var}(I_j) = E[I_j^2] - E[I_j]^2 =
1^2 \left(\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d}\right) - \left(\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d}\right)^2 =
\frac{$vijn}{$vijd}. \]
Then the covariance between pairs of the \(I_j\) is
\[ \mbox{Cov}(I_j,I_k) = E[I_j I_k] - E[I_j] E[I_k] = E[I_j I_k] -
\left(\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d}\right)^2. \]
The expectation
\[ E[I_j I_k] = 1^2\cdot P\lbrace I_j = 1, I_k = 1\rbrace
= P\lbrace I_j = 1|I_k = 1\rbrace \cdot P\lbrace I_k = 1\rbrace
= P\lbrace I_j = 1|I_k = 1\rbrace \left(\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d}\right). \]
We can find the first probability as we did before, taking out the known
selected fish:
\[ P\lbrace I_j = 0|I_k = 1\rbrace = \frac{$nfm2}{$nfm1}\cdots
\frac{$nfmnt}{$nfmntp1} = \frac{$nfmnt}{$nfm1}, \]
and by extension
\( P\lbrace I_j = 1|I_k = 1\rbrace = 1 - \frac{$nfmnt}{$nf} \).
Doing the sums to find the variance, we have
\[ \mbox{Var}(X) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc} \frac{$vijn}{$vijd} +
2\sum\limits_{j=1}^{$nc}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{j-1} \left((1 - \frac{$nfmnt}{$nfm1})(\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d}) - (\frac{$pr1n}{$pr1d})^2\right) = \frac{$varxn}{$varxd}. \]
