BEGIN_TEXT

It is reasonable to model the number of winter storms in a season
as with a Poisson random variable.  Suppose that in a good year the
average number of storms is $m1, and that in a bad year the average
is $m2.  If the probability that next year will be a good year is
$p1 and the probability that it will be bad is $p2, find the
expected value and variance in the number of storms that will occur.
$PAR
expected value = \{ $ex->ans_rule() \}
$BR
variance = \{ $var->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The expected value for the number of storms \(N\) is calculated by
conditioning on the year:
\[ E[N] = $p1 ($m1) + $p2 ($m2) = $ex. \]
$PAR

To find the variance, we have
\[ \mbox{Var}(N) = E[N^2] - E[N]^2 = E[N^2] - $ex^2. \]
The expected value of \(N^2\) may also be found by conditioning on
the type of year:
\[ E[N^2] = E[N^2|Y = \mbox{good}]\cdot $p1 + E[N^2|Y = \mbox{bad}]\cdot $p2,\]
where \(E[N^2|Y] = \mbox{Var}(N|Y) + E[N|Y]^2\) in either case.
Noting that for a Poisson random variable, the mean and variance are
equal, this gives
\[ E[N^2|Y=\mbox{good}] = $m1 + $m1^2 = $m1m1sq,\quad\mbox{and}\quad
E[N^2|Y=\mbox{good}] = $m2 + $m2^2 = $m2m2sq. \]
Thus
\[ E[N^2] = $p1 ($m1m1sq) + $p2 ($m2m2sq) = $ensq, \]
and
\[ \mbox{Var}(N) = $ensq - $ex^2 = $var. \]
