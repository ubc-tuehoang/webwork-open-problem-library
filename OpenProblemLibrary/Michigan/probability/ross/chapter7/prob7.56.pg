BEGIN_TEXT

Consider an elevator in a building with \(N\) floors above the ground
floor.  If the number of people entering an elevator on the ground floor
is a Poisson random variable with mean \($l\), and if each person is
equally likely to get off at any floor, independently of the others,
compute the expected number of stops that the elevator will make before
discharging all of its passengers.
$PAR
\(E[\mbox{stops}] = \) \{ $en->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

We calculate the expectation by conditioning on the number of people
who get into the elevator.  Let \(M\) be the number of people who get
into the elevator.  Then
\[ E[N] = \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\infty} E[N|M=m] P\lbrace M=m\rbrace. \]
(Obviously the number of people who are able to get into the elevator
will not be infinite, but we select the upper bound because of the
Poisson model that we're using.)  If \(F_j\) is an indicator variable
that is \(0\) or \(1\) according to whether anyone gets off the elevator
on floor \(j\), we have for \(M = m\) people in the elevator
\(P\lbrace F_j = 1\rbrace = 1 - (\frac{N-1}N)^m =
1 - (1 - \frac{1}N)^m\).  Then
\[ E[N|M=m] = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N} \left(1 - \left(1-\frac1N\right)^m\right) =
N\left(1 - \left(1 - \frac1N\right)^m\right). \]
Thus,
\[\begin{aligned} E[N] &= \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}
N \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac1N\right)^m\right)
e^{-$l}\frac{$l^m}{m!} \\
&= N \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty} e^{-$l}\frac{$l^m}{m!} -
N e^{-$l} \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty} \left(1-\frac1N\right)^m \frac{$l^m}{m!}\\
&= N - N e^{-$l} e^{$l(1 - 1/N)} = N(1 - e^{-$l/N}).
\end{aligned}\]
