BEGIN_TEXT

Consider a system with one component that is subject to failure, and
suppose that we have $n copies of the component.  Suppose further that
the lifespan of each copy is an independent exponential random variable
with mean $m days, and that we replace the component with a new copy
immediately when it fails.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Approximate the probability that the system is still working after
$tot days.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $prob->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Now, suppose that the time to replace the component is a random
variable that is uniformly distributed over \((0,0.5)\).  Approximate
the probability that the system is still working after $tot2 days.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $prob2->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Recall that the mean and variance of an exponential random variable
with parameter \(\lambda\) are \(1/\lambda\) and \(1/\lambda^2\),
respectively.  Thus variance in the lifespan of one of the copies
is \($msq\).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Let \(X_j\) be the lifespan of the \(j\)th copy of the
component; then the system is still functioning after $tot days if
\( X = X_1 + X_2 +\cdots + X_{$n} \ge $tot \).  Using the central
limit theorem and approximating by a normal distribution, we want
\[ P\lbrace \frac{X - ($m)($n)}{$m\sqrt{$n}} >
\frac{$tot - ($m)}{$m\sqrt{$n}} \rbrace \approx
P\lbrace Z > $z_score_r\rbrace = 1 - \Phi($z_score_r) \approx $prob_r. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
We note that the replacement times \(U_j\) have means \(\frac14\) and
variances \(\frac1{48}\).  There are several ways to approach this; one
is to note that, by the central limit theorem (assuming that $n is large
enough),
\(X = X_1 + \cdots + X_{$n} \sim N($nm, $nmsq)\) and
\(U = U_1 + \cdots + U_{$nm1} \sim N($nm1/4, $nm1/48)\).
Thus \(Y = X + U \sim N($nm + $nm1/4, $nmsq + $nm1/48)\), and we want the
probability \(P\lbrace Y > $tot2\rbrace\).  We may calculate this as
before, finding
\[ P\lbrace Y > $tot2 \rbrace \approx
P\lbrace Z > \frac{$tot2 - $m2}{\sqrt{$var2_r}}\rbrace =
1 - \Phi($z_score2_r) \approx $prob2_r. \]
