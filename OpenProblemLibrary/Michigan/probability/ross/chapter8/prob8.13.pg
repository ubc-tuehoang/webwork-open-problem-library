Let us suppose that a certain probability instructor manages, with
probability 1, to write exams that have mean \($mu\) and standard
deviation \($sd\).  The instructor is teaching two classes, one of size
$c1 and the other of size $c2, and is about to give an exam to both
classes.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Approximate the probability that the average test score in the class
of size $c1 exceeds $sc.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $pc1->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Repeat part (a) for the class of size $c2.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $pc2->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Approximate the probability that the average test score in the larger
class exceeds that of the other by more than $pdiff points.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $px1->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
Approximate the probability that the average test score in the smaller
class exceeds that in the other by more than $pdiff points.
$BR
Probability \(\approx\) \{ $px2->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$pc1$PAR
Note that for either class, we can employ the central limit theorem
to approximate the distribution of the class average as a normal
random variable with mean \($mu\) and standard deviation
\($sd/\sqrt{n}\) (where \(n\) is the number of students in the class).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The class average for this class is \(\approx N($mu, ($sd/$c1s)^2)\),
so we want
\[ P\lbrace Z > \frac{$sc - $mu}{$sd/$c1s}\rbrace = $pc1. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Similarly, here the class average is \(\approx N($mu, ($sd/$c2s)^2)\),
so we have
\[ P\lbrace Z > \frac{$sc - $mu}{$sd/$c2s}\rbrace = $pc2. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Next, the difference between the larger and smaller classes test averages
is approximately \(N(0, ($sd/$c1s)^2 + ($sd/$c2s)^2)\), so we are looking
for
\[ P\lbrace Z > \frac{ $pdiff }{\sqrt{($sd/$c1s)^2 + ($sd/$c2s)^2}}\rbrace
= $px1. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
Note that the distribution doesn't change when we look at the difference
between the smaller and larger classes.  Thus our probability is the same
as in (c), \($px2\).
