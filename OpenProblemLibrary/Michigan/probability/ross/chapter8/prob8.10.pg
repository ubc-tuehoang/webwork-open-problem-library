BEGIN_TEXT

A civil engineering model for \(W\), the weight (in units
of 1000 pounds) that a span of a bridge can withstand without
sustaining structural damage is normally distributed.  Suppose
that for a certain span \(W\sim N($bmu, $bsd^2)\).  Suppose
further that the weight of cars traveling on the bridge is
a random variable with mean \($cmu\) and standard deviation
\($csd\).  Approximately how many cars would have to be on the
bridge span simultaneously to have a probability of structural
damage that exceeded \(0.1\)?
$PAR
Approximately \{ $num->ans_rule() \} cars (round to an integer
number).

BEGIN_SOLUTION

First, note that for \(n\) cars each with a weight modeled by a
random variable \(C_j\) having mean \($cmu\) and standard deviation
\($csd\), the sum of the cars' weights, \(C\) is, by the central limit
theorem, approximately normal with mean \($cmu n\) and variance
\($csd^2 n\).  We have that the weight capacity of the bridge is
also \(N($bmu, $bsd^2)\).
$PAR
Then, we want to find the value of \(n\) for which
\(P\lbrace C > W\rbrace = P\lbrace C-W > 0\rbrace > 0.1\).
Because \(C\) is approximately normal, the difference \(C - W\)
will be approximately normal, with distribution
\(N($cmu n - $bmu, $csd^2 n + $bsd^2)\), and we can calculate the
desired probability as
\[ P\lbrace Z < -\frac{$cmu n - $bmu}{\sqrt{$csd^2 n + $bsd^2}}\rbrace
< 0.9. \]
The z-score required for a probability of \(0.9\) is $zsc, so that,
solving for \(n\), we find \(n \ge $nval_r\).  We conclude the number
of cars is therefore $num.
