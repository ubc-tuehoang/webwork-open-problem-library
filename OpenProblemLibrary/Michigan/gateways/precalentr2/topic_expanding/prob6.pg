$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We expand the multiplied terms by distributing:
\[\begin{aligned}
($a + $a x)(-$b x + $c) &= $a(-$b x + $c) + $a x (-$b x + $c)\\
  &= -$ab x + $ac - $ab x^2 + $ac x\\
  &= -$ab x^2 $s $acmab x + $ac.
\end{aligned}\]
This is not available in the list of expressions, so none of the
expressions is equivalent to that which is given.
