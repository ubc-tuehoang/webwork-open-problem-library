$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

When multiplying we add exponents.  Here,
\[ $n + \frac{$nm1}{$n} = \frac{$nsq}{$n} + \frac{$nm1}{$n} =
   \frac{$nsqpnm1}{$n}, \]
so that
\[ $u^{$n}\, $u^{$nm1/$n} = $u^{$nsqpnm1/$n}. \]
This is not one of the provided answers, however, so the correct
answer is "None of these expressions are equivalent."
