$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Exponents distribute across products, so we have 
\[  ($m\, $W^{2})^{1/4} = $m^{1/4} \, ($W^{2})^{1/4} . \]
Then rules of exponents allow us to simplify the second term by multiplying exponents, so that
\[  ($m\, $W^{2})^{1/4} = $m^{1/4} \, ($W^{2})^{1/4} = $m^{1/4} \, $W^{1/2}. \]
