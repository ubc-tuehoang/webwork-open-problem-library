$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Exponents distribute across products, so we have 
\[  ($W\, $m^{6})^{8/3} = $W^{8/3}\, ($m^{6})^{8/3} . \]
Then rules of exponents allow us to simplify the second term by multiplying exponents, so that
\[ ($W\, $m^{6})^{8/3} = $W^{8/3}\, ($m^{6})^{8/3} = $W^{8/3} \, $m^{16} . \]
