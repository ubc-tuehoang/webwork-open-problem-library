$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Exponents distribute across products, so we have 
\[ ($c^{3/2}\,  $d)^{2/3} = ($c^{3/2})^{2/3}\, $d^{2/3}. \]
Then rules of exponents allow us to simplify the first term by
multiplying exponents, so that
\[  ($c^{3/2} \, $d)^{2/3} = ($c^{3/2})^{2/3}\, $d^{2/3} = $c \, $d^{2/3}. \]
