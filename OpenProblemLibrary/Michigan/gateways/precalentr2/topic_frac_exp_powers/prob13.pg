$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Exponents distribute across products, so we have 
\[ ($d^{6/8}\, $t)^{2/3} = ($d^{6/8})^{2/3} \, $t^{2/3}  . \]
Then rules of exponents allow us to simplify the first term by multiplying exponents, so that
\[  ($d^{6/8}\, $t)^{2/3} = ($d^{6/8})^{2/3} \, $t^{2/3} = $d^{12/24}\, $t^{2/3} = $d^{1/2} \, $t^{2/3}. \]
