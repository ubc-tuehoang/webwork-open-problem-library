BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
The bullet with horizontal velocity of \(v_m = $Vm\) \(m/s\) strikes the compound pendulum, which is initially at rest. The compound pendulum and the bullet have masses \(M =\) \($Mass_pendulum_kg\) \(kg\) and \(m = $Mass_bullet_g\) \(g\), respectively. The height of the pendulum centre of gravity \(G\) is \(h_{pendulum} = $Height_pendulum_G m\); the width of the pendulum, \(w\) is \($Width_pendulum cm\); and the height at which the bullet strikes, \(h_{bullet}\) is \($Height_bullet m\).  
$PAR
Determine the angular velocity of the compound pendulum and the bullet immediately after the strike which causes the bullet to be embedded in the pendulum. The radius of gyration of the pendulum is \(k_O =$Ko\) \(cm\) around point \(O\). 
Also calculate the following parameters:
$PAR
Angular momentum of the bullet before the strike about point \(O\), \(H_{bullet}\)
$PAR
Angular momentum of the pendulum before the strike about point \(O\), \(H_{pendulum}\)
$PAR
Mass moment of inertia of both of the bullet and pendulum about point \(O\), \(I_O\).
