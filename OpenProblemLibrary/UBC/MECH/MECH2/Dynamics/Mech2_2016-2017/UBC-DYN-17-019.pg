$PAR
A wood bar with the length of \($L\) \(m\) and mass of \($Mass_2\) \(kg\) is moving vertically in \(x\)-\(y\) plane with the speed of \($V_mass2\) \(m/s\). A particle with the mass of \($Mass_1\) \(kg\) and the linear speed of \($V_mass1\) \(m/s\) impacts the wood bar. After the strike between the bar and the particle, the particle is embedded in the bar and both of them obtain the same velocities. Calculate the following parameters: (Note, the bar is uniform and slender). $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1. The distance between the impact point of the particle and center of gravity of both particle and bar after the impact \(Y_G\)$BR
