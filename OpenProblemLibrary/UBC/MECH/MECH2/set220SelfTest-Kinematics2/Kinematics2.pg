BEGIN_TEXT

Two cars are travelling on the same straight road in the same direction. Car B is travelling at the constant speed of \(72\) \(km/hr\). Car A is travelling at the constant speed \(v_A\), approaching Car B from behind. The driver of Car B notices Car A when it is still \(60\) \(m\) behind him. Car B accelerates at the constant rate of \(0.75\) \(m/s^2\) to avoid being struck by car A. Knowing that the closest that A comes to B is \(6\) \(m\), determine the speed \(v_A\) of car A.
