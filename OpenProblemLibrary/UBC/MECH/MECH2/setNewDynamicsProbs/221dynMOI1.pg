$PAR
Find the mass moment of inertia, \(Izz\), for the spherical ceramic femoral head ball (with a cylindrical hole) from a total hip replacement. Assume that \(r\) = $r cm, and density is a uniform $rho g/cm\(^3\). 

$PAR
(Recall that reasonable approximations around the intersection of round and flat objects are acceptable; select a simple approximation).
