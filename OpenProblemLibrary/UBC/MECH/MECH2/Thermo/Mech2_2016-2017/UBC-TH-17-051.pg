BEGIN_PGML

It can be shown that, for an ideal compressor operating at steady state, the specific work input required, [`w_\text{in}`] is [`\int_\text{in}^\text{out} v\,\text{d}P`] (note: although this looks like the expression for boundary work, [`P`] and [`v`] are in the opposite positions). Consider an ideal compressor at steady state which is pressurizing helium from [`[$P1]\,\text{bar}`], [`[$T1]\,^\circ\text{C}`] to [`[$P2]\,\text{MPa}`]. What is the specific work input required to power the compressor if the compression process is slow and isothermal?

You may assume that the specific heat of helium at any temperature is the same as that at [`25\,^\circ\text{C}`].

*Answer*:

[`w_\text{in} = `][_________]{$Wslow} [`\text{kJ/kg}`] (answer tolerance: [`1\,\text{kJ/kg}`])
