BEGIN_TEXT 
Steam at \(40 {^\circ}C\) condenses on the outside of a \($L\) \(m\) long,
\($D\) \(cm \) diameter thin horizontal copper tube. This heats the
water runnning through the tube. This water enters the tube at \($Ti_w {^\circ}C\) at an average velocity of \($Velocity\)
\(m/s\) and leaves at \($To_w {^\circ}C\). Determine:$BR

$SPACE 1. the mass flow rate of water$BR
$SPACE 2. heat transfer to the water along the tube$BR
$SPACE 3. enthalpy change for condensed steam $BR
$SPACE 4. rate of condensation of steam $BR
