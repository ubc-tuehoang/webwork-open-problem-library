BEGIN_PGML
The fact that pressure and temperature are related during a phase change is extremely useful when cooking: since earth's atmosphere exerts an essentially constant pressure, cooks can expect roughly the same temperature wherever and whenever they boil water. There are, of course, other ways of maintaining a constant temperature, but they are generally more complicated and/or less reliable.

Unfortunately, this "trick" does not work perfectly: atmospheric pressure varies with elevation, so boiling temperature isn't the same everywhere. What would the temperature of boiling water be:

a) In Denver, where [`P_\text{atm} = 83\,\text{kPa}`]: [_________]{94.282} [`^\circ\,\text{C}`]
b) At the summit of Mt. Everest, where [`P_\text{atm} = 33.7\,\text{kPa}`]: [_________]{71.6049} [`^\circ\,\text{C}`]

When cooking in these locations, it is necessary to adjust boiling times.
