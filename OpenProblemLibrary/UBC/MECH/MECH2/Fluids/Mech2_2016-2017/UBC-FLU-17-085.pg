$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Bernoulli Head is also called "Total Head". It is comprized of all the terms in the Bernoulli Equation (pressure, velocity, and elevation) expressed in the form of head. That is, the regular form of Bernoulli's Equation
$PAR
\(p+\frac{1}{2} \rho U^2+\rho g z = constant \)
$PAR
is divided by \(\rho g\) to give 
$PAR
\(\frac{p}{\rho g}+\frac{1}{2g}U^2 + z = constant\)
