At the entrance of a hydraulic (water) system the total head is \(0.75\) \(m\). At the exit point, located \(0.3\) \(m\) above the entrance, the flow velocity is \(2.5\) \(m/s\). Determine the pressure at the exit point if there was a head loss of \(0.12\) \(m\) due to friction.

At the entrance of a hydraulic (water) system the total head is 0.75 m. At the exit point, located 0.3 m above the entrance, the flow velocity is 2.5 m/s. Determine the pressure at the exit point if there was a head loss of 0.12 m due to friction. $PAR

 $PAR
At entrance:$PAR
\(H_{1} = 0.75 m \)$PAR
\(z_{1} = 0 m \)$PAR
 $PAR
At exit:$PAR
\(H_{2} = H_{1} - 0.12m \)$PAR
\(= 0.63 m\)$PAR
\(z_{2} = 0.3 m \)$PAR
\(U_{2} = 2.5 m/s \)$PAR
 $PAR
$PAR
From Equation 4:$PAR
 
\(p_{2} = \rho g H_{2} - \frac{1}{2} \rho U_{2}^2 - \rho g z_{2} \)$PAR
\(= \rho g (H_{2} - z_{2}) - \frac{1}{2} \rho U_{2}^2 \)$PAR
\(= (998)(9.81)(0.63 - 0.30) - \frac{1}{2}(998)(2.5)^2 \)$PAR
\(= 112 Pa \)
