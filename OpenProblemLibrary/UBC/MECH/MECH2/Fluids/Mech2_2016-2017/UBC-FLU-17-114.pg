BEGIN_PGML
The density of a liquid is to be determined by an old [`1`] [`cm`] diameter cylindrical hydrometer whose division marks are completely wiped out. The hydrometer is first dropped in water of density [`1000`] [`kg/m^3`], and the water level is marked. The hydrometer is then dropped into the other liquid, and it is observed that the mark for water has risen [`[$a]`] [`cm`] above the liquid-air interface. If the height of the watermark is [`[$b]`] [`cm`], determine the density of the liquid. Note: Treat the hydrometer as being perfectly cylindrical.


[`\rho_{liquid}=`] [_______]{$h} [`kg/m^3`]
