Four pharmaceutical drugs,
suspected of decreasing the rate of growth of a brain tumour,
were compared in an experiment involving 20 mice.
The mice were randomly divided into four groups,
with each group receiving one of the drugs in its diet.
At the end of the experiment,
the following data on tumour size were recorded.

$BR
$BR
$drug1Output 
$BR
$drug2Output 
$BR
$drug3Output 
$BR
$drug4Output 
$BR
$BR

Put the data in an R data frame with 20 rows and 2 columns.
Column 1 should contain treatment labels generated as follows.

$BR
$BR
drug <- rep(c(1:4), each = 5)
$BR
$BR
Be sure to make this column a factor.
The second column should have the above tumour sizes, 
stacked with the data for drug1 followed by the data for drug2, etc.

$BR

Compute an appropriate analysis of variance table using R.

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD [A] $EBOLD How many degrees of freedom for treatments are there?
\{  ans_rule(4) \}

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD [B] $EBOLD How many degrees of freedom for replication are there?
\{  ans_rule(4) \}

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD [C] $EBOLD What is the value of the \(F\) statistic that tests all treatment means are equal? Report your answer to one decimal place.
$BR
\{  ans_rule(7) \}

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD [D] $EBOLD What is the \(p\)-value for the above test? Report your answer to three decimal places.
$BR
\{  ans_rule(7) \}

$BR

$BBOLD [E] $EBOLD Plot the data.
What is the $BBOLD best $EBOLD interpretation of the plot?
