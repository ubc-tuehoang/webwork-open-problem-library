Suppose that in the adult population of the capital city of the country,
Kinshasa, @ppercent[0]% can speak French. Suppose two adults are chosen at
random from the population of Kinshasa. Let A denote the event that both
adults selected can speak French. What is the complement of event A?", "$table0"

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The sample space consists of possible outcomes for the trial
described, whereby two citizens of the city of Kinshasa are selected at
random and it is determined whether each speaks French. The sample space
consists of the set of possible pairs of outcomes for the two people
selected, and is as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
$table4
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
There are four outcomes, one of which is
	A =  \( ( \text{Speaks French, Speaks French} ) \).
The remaining outcomes comprise the complement of A.
