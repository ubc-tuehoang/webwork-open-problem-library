BEGIN_TEXT
Helen has two examinations in a month, one in History and one in
French. She believes she has a probability of @ph[0] of scoring an
"A" grade in the History test. She
decides that her performance on the two examinations are not independent. In
particular, if she were to score an "A" grade on the History examination she
believes her chance of an "A" in French would be @pfh[0]. On the other
hand, if she does not score an "A" on the History test, she thinks her
chance of scoring an "A" on the French test is only @pfnh[0]. Provide
answers to the following to two decimal places. 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD What is the probability Helen scores an "A" on both tests? 
\{ ans_rule(6) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The result for the French examination comes out first. Helen learns
she scored an "A" in the French test. Given this information, what is the
probability she scored an "A" in the History test?  \{ ans_rule(6) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
 (a) We require \( P\left( A\text{ in History and A in French}
\right) \) which by the general multiplicative rule is
$BR
$BR
\(
P\left( \text{A in History}\right) P\left( \text{A in French | A in History}\right) =@ph[0] \times @pfh[0] = @ans1[0].
\)
$BR
$BR
(b) We are asked to find \( P\left( \text{A in History | A in French}\right) \) which via Bayes' theorem or otherwise is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{P\left( \text{A in History and A in French}\right) }{P\left( \text{A
in French}\right) } &=& \frac{@ph[0] \times @pfh[0]}{@ph[0]\times @pfh[0]+
\left( 1-@ph[0]\right) \times @pfnh[0]} \\
&=& @ans2[0]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
