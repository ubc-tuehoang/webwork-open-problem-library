SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
${PAR}SOLUTION:$PAR
The conditional probability that she left it in the 5th class, given that she 
left it in one of the five classes, is 
\[\frac{P(\text{left in 5th class AND left in some class})}{P(\text{left in some class})}.\]
$PAR
To leave it in the 5th class she must leave it in some class, so the probability in the numerator is just the probability that she left it in the 5th class.
\[ P(\text{left in 5th class AND left in some class})= P(\text{left in 5th class}). \]
$PAR 
The probability that she left in the 5th class is the probability that she did not leave it in the first 4 classes then left it in the next class, so the numerator in the conditional probability expression is 
\[ \begin{aligned}P(\text{left in 5th class AND left in some class})&= P(\text{left in 5th class})\\ &=\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^4 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right).\end{aligned} \]

The probability in the denominator of the conditional probability expression is 1 minus the probability that she left it in $BITAL none $EITAL of the five classes:  
\[ P(\text{left in some class}) = 1-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5. \]

Thus the conditional probability is
\[ \frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^4 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{1-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5}. \]
