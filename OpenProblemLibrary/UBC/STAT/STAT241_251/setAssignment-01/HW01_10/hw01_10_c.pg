If she arrives home without her iClicker device and she is sure she
has the iClicker device after leaving the first class, what is the
probability (to at least 3 significant figures) that she left it in the 5th
class?

${PAR}SOLUTION:$PAR
Assuming she is correct that she didn't lose the device in her first 
class then the answer is the conditional probability
\[ \begin{gathered} P(\text{lost it in 5th class GIVEN THAT lost it in last 4 classes}) \\ = \frac{P(\text{lost it in 5th class AND lost it in last 4 classes})}{P(\text{lost it in last 4 classes})}\end{gathered}.\]
$PAR
Now 
\[ P(\text{lost it in 5th class AND lost it in last 4 classes}) = P(\text{lost it in 5th class}) \]
because if she lost it in the 5th class she certainly must have lost it in the last 4 classes.  To lose it in the 5th class she must $BITAL not $EITAL lose it in classes 2, 3, and 4, then lose it in the next class, so 
\[ P(\text{lost it in 5th class}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right).\]
$PAR
Finally the probability that she lost it in the last 4 classes is 1 minus the probability that she did $BITAL not $EITAL lose it in the last 4 classes
\[ P(\text{lost it in last 4 classes}) = 1-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^4. \]
$PAR
Thus the conditional probability is 
\[ \begin{gathered} \frac{P(\text{lost it in 5th class AND lost it in last 4 classes})}{P(\text{lost it in last 4 classes})} \\
  = \frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{1-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^4}\end{gathered}. \]
