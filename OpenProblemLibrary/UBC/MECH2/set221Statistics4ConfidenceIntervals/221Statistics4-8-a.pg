BEGIN_TEXT
		
An engine manufacturer wants to make sure that the power output of engines coming off a production line differ by no more than \(\pm\)\($C\) HP with 90% confidence. The target power output is 150 HP. If 20 engines are tested at random, what is the largest sample standard deviation (in HP) that would be permitted if the engines are to remain within specification?
