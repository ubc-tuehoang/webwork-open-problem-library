A report states that a poll of \($n\) citizens reveals \($x\)% of citizens are in favour of a new hydroelectric plant. The report also states that the survey standard deviation is \($S\)%. Assuming the surveyed citizens are representative of all citizens, what is the minimum level of support that can be expected for this project? The value you report should be true 19 times out of 20. (Give answer in % but do not include the % sign.)
