An engineer pulls a control handle to operate a machine. The handle is attached at the upper end of a rigid shaft, at \(D\). The lower end of the shaft is pinned at \(A\). A nylon rope joins to the shaft at \(B\), and is secured at \(C\). In a separate test, it was found that the rope stretched by 1% when a tensile force of \(100\) \(N\) was applied. The engineer pulls with a force \(F = $F\) \(N\). How far does point \(D\) of the handle move (in \(mm\))? Dimensions \(AB = $AB\) \(mm\), \(BC = $BC\) \(mm\), and \(BD = $BD\) \(mm\).
