A railroad car travels at \(30\) \(m/s\) due East, as shown in the image below. A softball pitcher stands on the top of the car and faces approximately East. She throws a ball horizontally at \(35\) \(m/s\) relative to the car, at an angle of \(20\) degrees to the axis of the railroad car. What is the velocity of the ball relative to the ground?
