An electronics store expects to sell $d laptops at a steady rate next year. The manager 
of the store plans to order these laptops from the manufacturer by placing several orders of 
the same size spaced equally throughout the year. The ordering cost for each delivery is 
$DOLLAR$k for the setup costs and $DOLLAR$p per laptop. The carrying costs, based on the average number of laptops in inventory, amount to $DOLLAR$h per year for one laptop. 

$PAR
If \(C(x)\) is the inventory cost (which is the sum of the ordering costs and the carrying costs) and $BBOLD \(x\) $EBOLD is the$BBOLD number of orders $EBOLD.
$BR \(C(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
How many orders should the store manager place? \{ans_rule(10)\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION') );
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Since the cost per laptop in the shipment does not depend on the size of the shipment, the total shipment cost is: \(\left($k x+ $pd\right)\).  The average number of laptops in the inventory will be half of the shipment size, \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{$d}{x}\right) = \frac{$d2}{x}\), so the total carrying cost will be: \($h\left(\frac{$d2}{x}\right) = \frac{$prod}{x}\).

$PAR Therefore:  \(C(x) = $k x + \frac{$prod}{x} + $pd\).

$PAR
We can find max/min values by solving for \(x\) when \(C'(x) =0\).
$BR \(0=C'(x) = $k - \frac{$prod}{x^2}\)
$BR \(x^2= \frac{$prod}{$k}\)
$BR \(x = $rule\).

$PAR

You now need to check \(C(x)\) at this value, as well as at the end points (\(x=1,$d\)).
$BR \(C(1) = $f1\)
$BR \(C($d) = $fd\)
$BR \(C($rule) = $fx\)

$PAR Therefore there should be $x shipments.
