BEGIN_PGML

A test has [`[$totalProblems]`] problems, which are worth a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points. There are two types of problems in the test. Each multiple-choice problem is worth [`[$worthMulti]`] points, and each short-answer problem is worth [`[$worthShort]`] points. 

Write and solve a system equation to answer the following questions.

    This test has [__________]{$numMulti} multiple-choice problems and [___________]{$numShort} short-answer problems.

$s1 = $totalPoints - $worthShort*$totalProblems;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the test has [`x`] multiple-choice problems, and [`y`] short-answer problems.

It's given that there are a total of [`[$totalProblems]`] problems, so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$totalProblems] ``]

Since each multiple-choice problem is worth [`[$worthMulti]`] points, [`x`] multiple-choice problems would be worth [`[$worthMulti]x`] points.

Similarly, since each short-answer problem is worth [`[$worthShort]`] points, [`y`] short-answer problems would be worth [`[$worthShort]y`] points.

It's given that all problems in the test are worth a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points, so we have:

    [`` [$worthMulti]x+[$worthShort]y=[$totalPoints] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$totalProblems] \\
  [$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort]y &= [$totalPoints]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We will use substitution to solve this problem. First, we solve for [`y`] in the first equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x+y &= [$totalProblems] \\
   x+y \mathbf{{}-x} &= [$totalProblems]\mathbf{{}-x} \\
   y &= -x+[$totalProblems]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Next, we substitute [`y`] with [`-x+[$totalProblems]`] in [`[$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort]y = [$totalPoints]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort]y &= [$totalPoints] \\
   [$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort](-x+[$totalProblems]) &= [$totalPoints] \\
   [$worthMulti]x -[$worthShort]x+[$worthShort*$totalProblems] &= [$totalPoints] \\
   [$worthMulti-$worthShort]x +[$worthShort*$totalProblems] &= [$totalPoints] \\
   [$worthMulti-$worthShort]x +[$worthShort*$totalProblems] \mathbf{{}-[$worthShort*$totalProblems]} &= [$totalPoints] \mathbf{{}-[$worthShort*$totalProblems]} \\
   [$worthMulti-$worthShort]x &= [$s1] \\
   x &= [$numMulti]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Finally, we substitute [`x=[$numMulti]`] into [`y = -x+[$totalProblems]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   y &= -x+[$totalProblems] \\
   y &= -[$numMulti]+[$totalProblems] \\
   y &= [$numShort]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`x=[$numMulti],y=[$numShort]`]. This implies there are [`[$numMulti]`] multiple-choice questions and [`[$numShort]`] short-answer questions in the test.
