Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 
\(!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\) \(\textrm{cm}^3/\textrm{min}\) 
at the same time that water is being pumped  into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height \(!{$height:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\) and the the diameter at the top is \(!{$diameter:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\).  If the water level is rising at a rate of 
\( !{$levelRate:%5.1f} \ \textrm{cm}/\textrm{min}\) when the height of the water is \(! {$level:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\), find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute.

$BR$BR
Let \(R\) be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in.  Then you know that if \(V\) is volume of water, 
\(\frac{dV}{dt}=R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\).  Use geometry (similar triangles) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \)

$diametercm = 100*$diameter;
$heightcm = 100*$height;
$ansnum = $PI * $diameter*$diameter * $levelcm*$levelcm * $levelRate
  / (4 * $height*$height) + $flowRate;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$SOL
The volume \(V\) of a cone of diameter \(d\) and height \(h\) is
\[V=\frac{\pi d^2 h }{12}.\]
We might as well do this problem a little more generally than
stated.  (It actually makes things clearer to use variables throughout
and substitute specific values only at the end.) So suppose the
diameter of our tank is \(D\) and its height is \(H\).  Suppose the
depth of the water is \(h\) and the radius of the surface is \(r\).
Then, by similar triangles,
\[\frac{r}{h} = \frac{R}{H},\]
or
\[r= \frac{Rh}{H}.\]
Substituting in the volume formula gives
\[V= \frac{\pi D^2h^3}{12H^2}.\]
Differentiating gives:
\[V'= \frac{3\pi D^2h^2h'}{12H^2} = \frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}\]
This rate of change in volume would be the rate \(T\) at which water
is being pumped into the tank if there was no leak.  However, if \(L\)
is the leak rate then
\[T = L+\frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}.\]
$PAR
Note that since we have to have consistent units of length, and the answer is
in cubic centimeters per minute, the lengths given in meters have to
be converted to centimeters.
$PAR
Thus, substituting
\[L = $flowRate,\quad D = $diametercm,\quad H = $heightcm,
  \quad h = $levelcm,\quad h' = $levelRate\]
we obtain
\[T = $flowRate + \frac{\pi*$diametercm^2*$levelcm^2*$levelRate}{4*$heightcm^2}
  \approx !{$ansnum:%5.0f} \hbox{cm}^3/\hbox{min}.\]
