You say goodbye to your friend at the intersection of two
perpendicular roads.  At time \(t=0\) you drive off North at a
(constant) speed \(v\) and your friend drives West at a (constant)
speed \(w\).  You badly want to know: how fast is the distance between
you and your friend increasing at time \(t\)?  

$PAR Enter here the
derivative with respect to \(t\) of the distance between you and your friend:

\{ans_rule(20)\}
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD the next part will be $BBOLD MUCH $EBOLD easier if you simplify your answer to this part as much as possible.

END_TEXT

$ans1=Compute("sqrt(v^2+w^2)");

#ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,100],[1,100]], vars=>["v","w"]));

ANS($ans1->cmp());




BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

Being scientifically minded you ask yourself how does the speed of 
separation change with time.  In other words, what is the second
derivative of the distance between you and your friend?

$PAR 

\{ans_rule(20)\}
END_TEXT

ANS(Real(0)->cmp());
#ANS(num_cmp(0));


BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

Suppose that after your friend takes off (at time \(t=0\)) you linger
for an hour to contemplate the spot on which he or she was standing.
After that hour you drive off too (to the North). How fast is the
distance between you and your friend increasing at time \(t\) (greater
than one hour)?  

$PAR

\{ans_rule(60)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT

$ans3=Compute("(v^2*(t-1)+w^2*t)/sqrt(v^2*(t-1)^2+w^2*t^2)");
ANS($ans3->cmp());

#ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,100],[1,100],[1,2]], vars=>["v","w","t"]));

BEGIN_TEXT; 
Again, you ask what is the second derivative of your separation:
$PAR
\{ans_rule(90)\}
END_TEXT

$ans4=Compute("(v^2*w^2)/(sqrt((t-1)^2*v^2+w^2*t^2)*((t-1)^2*v^2+w^2*t^2))");
ANS($ans4->cmp());

#ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,100],[1,100],[1,2]], vars=>["v","w","t"]));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Notice how lingering can make things harder, mathematically speaking.
