Suppose that a company has fixed costs of \( $a \) dollars 
and variable costs
of \( $b x + $c \) dollars per unit,  
where \( x \) is the number of units produced.  
Suppose further that the selling price of its product is 
\( $d - $e x \) dollars per unit.  $PAR
(a) Find all the break-even points. Each point should be a pair of numbers \((x,p)\) where \(x\) is the number of units and \(p\) is the corresponding price in dollars.  If there are multiple break-even points separate them with commas, for example: \((x_1,p_1),(x_2,p_2),(x_3,p_3)\).   
$BR \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
(b) Find the maximum revenue in dollars.  
$BR \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR (c) What price in dollars will maximize profit? 
$BR \{ans_rule(70) \} 

$PAR Exact answers, or close decimal approximations are expected.  Do not round quantities to the nearest integer, do not round dollars to the nearest cent.
