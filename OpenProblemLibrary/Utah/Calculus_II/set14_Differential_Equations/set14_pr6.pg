BEGIN_TEXT

A spring with a spring constant \(k\) of 100 pounds per foot
is loaded with 1-pound weight and brought to equilibrium.  It
is then stretched an additional 1 inch and released.  Find
the equation of motion, the amplitude, and the period.  Neglect
friction.  

$PAR
The displacement \(y\), in feet from equilibrium is 
\( y(t) = \) \{ans_rule(80)\} $BR
where \(t\) is time in seconds since the spring was released, and the initial 1 in. stretch is regarded as a positive displacement.
$PAR

Amplitude: \{ans_rule(15)\} inch(es) $BR

Period:  \{ans_rule(15)\} second(s).
