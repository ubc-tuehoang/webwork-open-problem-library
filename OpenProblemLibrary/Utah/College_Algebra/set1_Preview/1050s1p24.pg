You are five feet tall, and walking in the forest.
You cast a shadow of length $s feet.  You rest under a tree with a
shadow of length $S feet. The height of the tree is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} feet.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since at any particlar time all objects cast
shadows at the same angle, the ratios of the height and the lenght of
the shadow of any two objects are the same.  In this case, if \(h\) is the
unknown height of the tree, we have that \[\frac{5}{$s} =
\frac{h}{$S}.\]
Thus
\[h = $S\times \frac{5}{$s} = $answer\hbox{~feet.}\]
