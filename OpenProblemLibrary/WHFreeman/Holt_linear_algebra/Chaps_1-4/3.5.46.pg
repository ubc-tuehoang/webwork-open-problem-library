$BR
In an office complex of $employees employees, on any given day
some are at work and the rest are absent. It is known that if an
employee is at work today, there is an $patworktoday% chance that she will be
at work tomorrow, and if the employee is absent today, there is a
$pabsenttoday% chance that she will be absent tomorrow. Suppose that today
there are $employeesatworktoday employees at work.
$PAR
($BBOLD a$EBOLD) Find the transition matrix for this scenario. (Assume the components of the state vector are listed in this order: [number at work, number absent]). $BR
\{$transition->ans_array\}
$PAR
($BBOLD b$EBOLD) Predict the number that will be at work five days from now. (Your answer should be an integer.)
$BR\{ans_rule\}  
$PAR
($BBOLD c$EBOLD) Find the steady-state vector. (The components need not be integers.)
