# Distance between a line parallel to a plane

Suppose you are given a line [` \mathcal{L}: \ \mathbf{x}(t) = A + t \mathbf{v} `] parallel to a plane [` \mathcal{P}: \mathbf{n} \cdot (X - B) `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance between the line [`\mathcal{L}`] and the plane [` \mathcal{P} `]?
Answer by dragging statements from the left column to the right column and putting them in the correct order in the right column.
Note: your answer does not need to use all of the statements from the left column.
Hint: draw a picture.

# Distance between skew lines

Suppose you are given a line [` \mathcal{L}_1 : \mathbf{x_1}(s) = A + s \mathbf{v} `] skew to another line [` \mathcal{L}_2 : \mathbf{x_2}(t) = B + t \mathbf{w} `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance between these lines?
Hint: draw a picture.
