# Distance between a point and a line

Suppose you are given a point [`B`] not on the line [` \mathcal{L}: \ \mathbf{x}(t) = A + t \mathbf{v} `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance between the point [`B`] and the line [`\mathcal{L}`]?
Answer by dragging statements from the left column to the right column and putting them in the correct order in the right column.
Note: your answer does not need to use all of the statements from the left column.
Hint: draw a picture.

# Distance between a point and a plane

Suppose you are given a point [`B`] not on the plane [` \mathcal{P} : \mathbf{n} \cdot ( \mathbf{x} - A) = 0 `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance from the point [`B`] to the plane [`\mathcal{P}`]?
Hint: draw a picture.
