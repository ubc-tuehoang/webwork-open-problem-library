BEGIN_PGML
Consider the series [`` \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [$a] ``].

a. The general formula for the sum of the first [`n`] terms is [` S_n = `] [_________]{$ans1}.  Your answer should be in terms of [`n`].

b. The sum of a series is defined as the limit of the sequence of partial sums, which means  

    [`` \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [$a] = \lim_{n \to \infty} \bigg( ``] [____________]{$ans2} [``\bigg) = ``] [_______]{$ans3}.
