BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In each case, the answer is either one extreme end of the interval (which can be seen clearly from a graph of the Bernstein polynomials) or it is where the polynomial's derivative is equal to zero.

In the linear case, the graph clearly shows there are no local maxima, but only maxima on the endpoints of the interval.  Thus the maximum for [`1-t`] is at [`t=0`] and for [`t`] is at [`t=1`].

[@ image(insertGraph($graph1), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>480) @]*

In the quadratic case, the graph clearly shows there are no local maxima for [`(1-t)^2`] or [`t^2`], but only maxima on the endpoints of the interval.  Thus the maximum for [`(1-t)^2`] is at [`t=0`] and for [`t^2`] is at [`t=1`].

[@ image(insertGraph($graph2), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>480) @]*

That leaves us with [`2t(1-t)`].  We simplify it to [`2t-2t^2`], compute its derivative as [`2-4t`], and ask where that derivative is zero.  The answer is at [`t=\frac12`], which fits with the graph we see above.

In the cubic case, the graph clearly shows there are no local maxima for [`(1-t)^3`] or [`t^3`], but only maxima on the endpoints of the interval.  Thus the maximum for [`(1-t)^3`] is at [`t=0`] and for [`t^3`] is at [`t=1`].

[@ image(insertGraph($graph3), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>480) @]*

That leaves us with [`3t(1-t)^2`] and [`3t^2(1-t)`].  We simplify the first of these to [`3t-6t^2+3t^3`], compute its derivative as [`3-12t+9t^2`], and ask where that derivative is zero.  The quadratic formula tells us it happens at [`t=\frac13`] and [`t=1`], and [`t=\frac13`] is the maximum in the graph we see above.

We simplify the second of these to [`3t^2-3t^3`], compute its derivative as [`6t-9t^2`], and ask where that derivative is zero.  Factoring into [`3t(2-3t)`] tells us it happens at [`t=0`] and [`t=\frac23`], and [`t=\frac23`] is the maximum in the graph we see above.

So in general, we see this pattern:

Linear maxima at 0 and 1

Quadratic maxima at 0, [`\frac12`], and 1

Cubic maxima at 0, [`\frac13`], [`\frac23`], and 1

So we conjecture that the maxima will always be at 0, [`\frac1n`], [`\frac2n`], [`\ldots`], and [`\frac{n-1}n`], for the [`n`]th degree Bernstein polynomials.
