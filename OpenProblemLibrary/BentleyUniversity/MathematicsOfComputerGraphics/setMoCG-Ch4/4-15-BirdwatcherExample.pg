BEGIN_PGML
Imagine a scene in which a birdwatcher, whose eye is located at [`([$x2],[$y2],[$z2])`], is watching a bird located at [`([$x1],[$y1],[$z1])`].

What is the vector from the birdwatcher's eye to the bird?
[`\langle`][_____]{$x1-$x2},[_____]{$y1-$y2},[_____]{$z1-$z2}[`\rangle`]

Express that vector as a direction (without magnitude).
[`\langle`][__________]{$ux},[__________]{$uy},[__________]{$uz}[`\rangle`]

Suppose the birdwatcher is using a telescope, which we wish to represent in a 3D scene as a cylinder extending from the birdwatcher's eye to the bird.  We know the center of one end of the cylinder (the eye point), but need to compute the other.  If the telescope is [$l] units long, what is the center of the other end of the telescope?

Answer: ([__________]{$x2+$l*$ux},[__________]{$y2+$l*$uy},[__________]{$z2+$l*$uz})

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Vectors between points are computed by subtracting the starting point from the ending point.  Thus in this case we have
[`( [$x1],[$y1],[$z1] ) - ( [$x2],[$y2],[$z2] )
= \langle [$x1-$x2],[$y1-$y2],[$z1-$z2] \rangle `]

Without its magnitude, this vector becomes a unit vector.  We compute that by dividing by the magnitude, so we must first compute that magnitude using the usual formula.

[`` ||\langle [$x1-$x2],[$y1-$y2],[$z1-$z2] \rangle||
= \sqrt{([$x1-$x2])^2 + ([$y1-$y2])^2 + ([$z1-$z2])^2}
\approx [$mag] ``]

[`` \frac{\langle [$x1-$x2],[$y1-$y2],[$z1-$z2] \rangle}{[$mag]}
    \approx \langle [$sux],[$suy],[$suz] \rangle ``]

The other end of the telescope can be computed from these tools.  We take the eye point and add the unit vector, scaled by the telescope length.

[`` ([$x2],[$y2],[$z2]) + [$l]\langle [$sux],[$suy],[$suz] \rangle
    \approx ([$sfinx],[$sfiny],[$sfinz]) ``]
