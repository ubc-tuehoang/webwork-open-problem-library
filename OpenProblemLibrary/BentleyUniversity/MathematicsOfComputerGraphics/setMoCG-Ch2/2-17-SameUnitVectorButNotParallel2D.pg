BEGIN_PGML
Consider the (approximate) unit vector [`\langle [$x],[$y] \rangle`].  Give another unit vector different from it, but still parallel to it.

Answer: [`\langle`][_______]{-$x},[_______]{-$y}[`\rangle`]
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Vectors are parallel if they are scalar multiples of one another.  If we multiply [`\langle [$x],[$y] \rangle`] by any scalar, it will change its length, making it no longer a unit vector, unless the scalar we choose is [`1`] or [`-1`].  Multiplying by [`1`] gives us the same vector again, but we were asked for a different one.  Thus we must choose [`-1\cdot\langle [$x],[$y] \rangle`], which is [`\langle [$x*-1],[$y*-1] \rangle`].
