TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Let us assume we have the line whose parametric equations are [`x=[$p1]+[$v1]t, y=[$p2]+[$v2]t, z=[$p3]+[$v3]t`] and the plane with equation [`[$A]x+[$B]y+[$C]z+[$D]=0`].

This line and this plane do not intersect, but let's pretend we did not know that, and attempted to find their point of intersection by substituting the parametric equations into the plane equation.

What goes wrong?  Be sure to phrase your answer in such a way that it explains how someone could tell, in a future situation, that a line and plane don't intersect.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
After substitution we have [`[$A]([$p1]+[$v1]t)+[$B]([$p2]+[$v2]t)+[$C]([$p3]+[$v3]t)+[$D]=0`], which simplifies to [`[$A*$p1+$B*$p2+$C*$p3+$D]=0`].

Since that equation is always false, regardless of what value we choose for [`t`], it has no solution, and thus there is no intersection between the line and the plane.
