TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
An animation has two scenes, each of them being one second long. In the first scene, an object moves along the path

>> [`\vec p_1(t) = \left( [$a]t^2+[$b]t, [$c]t^2+[$d], [$e]t^2+[$f]t+[$g] \right)`] <<

for [`0 \leq t \leq 1`]. At the end of the scene, the object's acceleration immediately becomes zero, and remains zero throughout the second scene.

The vector-valued function [`\vec p_2(t)`] for the object's path in the second scene also uses [`0 \leq t \leq 1`], so that [`t = 0`] in the second scene is the same moment as [`t = 1`] in the first scene. What is [`\vec p_2(t)`]?

Answer: [`\vec p_2(t)=(`][__________]{"$a+$b+($a*2+$b)*t"},[__________]{"$c+$d+$c*2*t"},[__________]{"$e+$f+$g+($e*2+$f)*t"}[`)`]
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Because there is a constant velocity throughout scene two, we know that its equation will be linear.  Thus we just need its starting point and its velocity, and we can use the standard method to create the equation of a line:

>> [`\vec p_2(t) = (\text{starting point}) + (\text{velocity})t`] <<

The starting point of scene two is the ending point of scene one, so we can just compute [`\vec p_1(1)`] to find that value.

[`\vec p_1(1)=([$a](1)^2+[$b](1),[$c](1)^2+[$d],[$e](1)^2+[$f](1)+[$g])=([$a+$b],[$c+$d],[$e+$f+$g])`]

The starting velocity of scene two (which is the velocity throughout all of scene two) is the ending velocity of scene one, so we can compute [`\vec p'_1(1)`] to find that velocity.

[`\vec p'_1(t)=\left\langle 2([$a])t+[$b],2([$c])t,2([$e])t+[$f] \right\rangle`]

[`\vec p'_1(1)=\left\langle [$a*2+$b],[$c*2],[$e*2+$f] \right\rangle`]

Thus the final answer is as follows.

[`\vec p_2(t)=([$a+$b],[$c+$d],[$e+$f+$g])+\left\langle [$a*2+$b],[$c*2],[$e*2+$f] \right\rangle t
=([$a+$b]+[$a*2+$b]t,[$c+$d]+[$c*2]t,[$e+$f+$g]+[$e*2+$f]t)`]
