BEGIN_PGML
Consider a cannonball launched along the path

>> [`\vec p(t)=([$f1],[$f2],[$f3]),`] <<

with length units in feet and time units in seconds.

When does it return to the height from which it was launched?  (The coordinate system is right-handed, with [`z`] the vertical axis.)

Answer: [`t=`][__________]{$ans1}

What is its velocity then?

Answer: [`\langle`][________]{$v1},[________]{$v2},[________]{$v3}[`\rangle`]

Momentum is mass times speed, usually measured in [`\frac{\text{kg m}}{\text{s}}`], but here we can measure it in [`\frac{\text{kg ft}}{\text{s}}`].  If the cannonball has mass [$mass] kg, what is its momentum upon impact with the ground?

Answer: [________]{$momentum} [`\frac{\text{kg ft}}{\text{s}}`]
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
It was launched at time [`t=0`], and [`\vec p(0)`] has a [`z`] coordinate of 0.  So the height at which it was launched was [`z=0`].  We ask when it returns to that height by setting the [`z`] component of [`\vec p(t)`] equal to zero, as in [`[$f3]=0`].  This factors as [`t([$coeff5]+[$coeff6]t)=0`], with solutions [`t=0`] and [`t=[$ans1]`].

To find the velocity when [`t=[$ans1]`], we must find the velocity function, [`\vec p'(t)`].  So we differentiate:

[`\vec p'(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\left([$f1],[$f2],[$f3]\right)
=\left\langle [$f1->D('t')],[$f2->D('t')],[$f3->D('t')] \right\rangle`]

We then plug in [`t=[$ans1]`]:  [`\vec p'([$ans1])=\left\langle [$v1],[$v2],[$v3] \right\rangle`].

Finding momentum requires first finding speed, which is the magnitude of velocity.  So we can take the previous answer and apply the formula for magnitude: [`\sqrt{([$v1])^2+([$v2])^2+([$v3])^2}\approx [$speed]`].

Momentum is mass times speed, so the answer for momentum is [`[$mass]\cdot[$speed]`], or [$momentum]  [`\frac{\text{kg ft}}{\text{s}}`].
