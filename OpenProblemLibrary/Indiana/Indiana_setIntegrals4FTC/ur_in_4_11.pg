BEGIN_HINT
There are two ways to solve this problem.
$PAR
The first (and better) way is to differentiate both sides of the above equation using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part I) on the integral.  This will give an equation that can be solved for f(x).  The value of the number a can be determined by integrating the original equation (i.e. the Evaluation Theorem).
$PAR
The second way (and a bit harder) is to simply guess the form of f(x) and integrate to see if you are right.  The value of the number a is determined as in the preceding paragraph above.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$SOL $BR
As the hint suggests, the best way to solve this problem is to first determine the form
of the function \( f(x) \) by using the first portion of the Fundamental Theorem of 
Calculus to find the the derivative.  First, we rearrange the equation as shown
below:
\[
  \int_{a}^{x} \frac {f(t)} {t^{$m}} dt = $c x^{$n} - $b
\]
Next, we differentiate both sides to get:
\[
  \frac{f(x)}{x^{$m}} = $d x^{ $f }
\]
Therefore, the function desired is:
\[
  f(x) = $d x^{ $e }
\]
Now, to determine the value of \( a \), we need to integrate the original expression
using our new information about \( f(t) \).  That is, we now have:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    $b + \int_{a}^{x} \frac{ $d t^$e}{t^$m} dt &= $c x^{$n} \\
    \int_{a}^{x} $d t^{ \{$f\} } dt &= $c x^{$n} - $b \\
    $c \left( x^{ $n } - a^{ $n } \right) &= $c x^{$n} - $b \\
    $c a^{$n} &= $b \\
    a^{$n} &= \frac{$b}{$c} \\
    a &=  $ans2
  \end{aligned}
\]
