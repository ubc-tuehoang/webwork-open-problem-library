We are using College Physics for AP Courses by Wolfe, et al, 2015
https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics-ap-courses
which shares the same Problems & Exercises as
College Physics by Urone, 2017, the problems found in
Contrib/BrockPhysics/College_Physics_Urone
Problems are being re-written in a style to make it easier
to verify the correctness of the problems and to add solutions
for students.

Chapters currently ready for consideration for inclusion into the OPL:
Contrib/Keele/College_Physics_Wolfe
* 9. Statics and Torque
* 11. Fluid Statics
* 25. Geometric Optics
* 27. Wave Optics
* 33. Particle Physics
