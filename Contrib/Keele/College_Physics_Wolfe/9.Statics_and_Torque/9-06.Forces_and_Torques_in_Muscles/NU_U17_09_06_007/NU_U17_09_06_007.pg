$PAR
Even when the head is held erect, as in the figure above, its centre of mass is not directly
over the principal point of support (the atlanto-occipital joint). The muscles at the
back of the neck should therefore exert a force to keep the head erect. That is why
your head falls forward when you fall asleep in the class.
$PAR
a) Calculate the force exerted by these muscles using the information in the figure.
$PAR
\( F_M = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} downward

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

$PAR
b) What is the force exerted by the pivot on the head?
$PAR
\( F_J = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} upward

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
