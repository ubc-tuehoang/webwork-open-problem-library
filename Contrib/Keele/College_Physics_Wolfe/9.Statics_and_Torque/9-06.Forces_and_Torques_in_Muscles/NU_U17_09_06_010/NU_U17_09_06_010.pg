$PAR
Unlike most of the other muscles in our bodies, the masseter muscle in the jaw,
as illustrated in the figure above, is attached relatively far from the joint,
enabling large forces to be exerted by the back teeth.
$PAR
a) Using the information in the figure, calculate the force exerted by the teeth on the bullet.
$PAR
\( F_r = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} upward

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium.
Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
It may help you to recall Newton's Third Law.

b) Calculate the force on the joint.
$PAR
\( F_J = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} downward
