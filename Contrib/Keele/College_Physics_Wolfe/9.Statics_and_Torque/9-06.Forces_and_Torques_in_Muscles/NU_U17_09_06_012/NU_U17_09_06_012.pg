$PAR
a) What magnitude of force should the woman of mass \(m = $m\) in the figure above
exert on the floor with each hand to do a push-up?
Assume that she moves up at a constant speed.
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that "constant speed" may be interpreted as "zero net torque".
Note that the question is asking for the force exerted by $BITALIC each $EITALIC hand.
It might help you to recall Newton's Third Law.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) The triceps muscle at the back of her upper arm has an effective lever arm of \($rm\),
and she exerts force on the floor at a horizontal distance of \($re\) from the elbow joint.
Calculate the magnitude of the force in each triceps muscle.
$PAR
\( F_E = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Again, given that the woman moves at a constant speed, begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
It might help you to consider the torques exerted on one arm only.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
c) How much work does she do if her centre of mass rises \($d\)?
$PAR
\( W = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of work done by a constant force.
Given that the woman moves at a constant speed, to what must the upwardly-directed exerted force be equal?
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
d) What is her useful power output if she does \($rate\) pushups in one minute?
$PAR
\( P = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of average power.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

a)
Remember to divide by 2 to find the force exerted by each hand
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_{reaction} = \frac{ ($m)($g)($rcom) }{ 2 \ ($rarm) } = $Fr \)
$PAR
b)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_{triceps} = F_{reaction} \frac{ $re }{ $rm } = $Ft \)
$PAR
c)
$PAR
\( W = F d = m g d = ($m)($g)($d) = $W \)
$PAR
d)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle P = \frac{W_{total}}{t} = \frac{ $rate \times $W }{ 60 \ \rm s } = $P \)
