Unreasonable Results:
Suppose two children are using a uniform seesaw that is \(3.00\) \(\textrm{m}\) long
and has its centre of mass over the pivot.
The first child has a mass of \($weight1\) and sits \($x1\) from the pivot.
$PAR
a) Calculate where the second \($weight2\) child must sit to balance the seesaw.
$PAR
\( x_2 = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} from the pivot on the opposite side of the seesaw.

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

(a)
$PAR
\( w_1 x_1 = w_2 x_2 \)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle x_2 = \frac{w_1}{w_2} x_1 = \frac{$weight1}{$weight2} \times $x1 = $x2 \)

(b) What is unreasonable about the result?

(c) Which premise is unreasonable, or which premises are inconsistant?
