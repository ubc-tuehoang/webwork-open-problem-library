BEGIN_TEXT

Two children push on opposite sides of a door during play. Both push horizontally and
perpendicular to the door. One child pushes with a force of \($F\) at a distance of
\($r1\) from the hinges, and the second child pushes at a distance of \($r2\).
$PAR
What force must the second child exert to keep the door from moving?
Assume friction is negligible.
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

To keep the door from moving, the torques must balance, so
\( F_2 \times r_2 = F_1 \times r_1 \)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_2 = F_1 \frac{r_1}{r_2} = $F1 \left( \frac{ $r1 }{ $r2 } \right) = $F2 \)
