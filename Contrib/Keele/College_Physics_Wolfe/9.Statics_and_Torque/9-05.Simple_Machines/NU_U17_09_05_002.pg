BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you needed to raise a \($m\) mower a distance of \(6.00 \ \textrm{cm}\)
above the ground to change a tire.
If you had a \($r\) long lever, where would you place the fulcrum
if your force was limited to \($F\) and the mower was situated on the right end of the lever?

$PAR
\( r_1 = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
from the right end of the lever

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
Is the height to which the mower would need to be raised relevant?
END_HINT

\( \displaystyle r_1 = \frac{ r_0 }{1 + \frac{m g}{F} }
  = \frac{ $r }{1 + \frac{($m) ($g)}{$F} }
