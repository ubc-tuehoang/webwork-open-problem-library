$PAR
In the figure above, the centre of gravity of the pole held by the pole vaulter
is \($h\) from the left hand, and the hands are \($l\) apart.
The pole has mass \($m\). Calculate the force exerted by

$PAR
a) his right hand and
$PAR
\( F_R = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.

\( w = m g \), where \(m\) is the mass of the pole
$PAR
(a)
Choose the left hand as the pivot and
make \(x_w\) the length from the left hand to the center of gravity
and \(x_r\) the distance between the hands.
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_R = \frac{m g x_w}{x_r} = \frac{ ($m) ($g) ($h) }{ $l }
