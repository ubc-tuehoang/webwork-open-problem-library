$PAR
a) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on each foot of the horse in
the above figure (two are on the ground), assuming the centre of mass of the horse is
midway between the feet. The total mass of the horse and rider is \($m\).

$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the vertical (wall)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given that the centre of mass is midway between its feet, what fraction of the horse's weight will each hoof support?
What then can be said about the normal force on each foot, and in turn, about the force of static friction?
You will need to use the second condition for static equilibrium to first work out the force exerted by the wall.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) What is the minimum coefficient of friction between the hooves and ground? Note that the force exerted by the wall is horizontal.

$PAR
\( \mu = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for static friction at its maximum.
For the horse not to move laterally, all horizontal forces must balance.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

For this you will need to know
$BR
\( \displaystyle F_{wall}
  = \frac{ r_{horse} (m g) }{ r_{wall} }
  = \frac{ ($rhorse)($m)($g) }{ $rwall }
  = $Fwall
\)
$PAR
Now, it's just a matter of vector addition of the forces.
The magnitude of the force balancing the two forces is given by
\( F = \sqrt{ (m g)^2 + F_{wall}^2 } \)
$PAR
For each hoof, divide this by two to get
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F
  = \frac{ \sqrt{ (m g)^2 + F_{wall}^2 } }{ 2 }
  = \frac{ \sqrt{ ($m \times $g)^2 + ($Fwall)^2 } }{ 2 }
  = $F
\)

$PAR
The angle is given by
\( \displaystyle \tan \theta = \frac{ F_{wall} }{ mg } \)
$PAR
so take the arctan to get \( \theta = $degrees^{\circ} \)

$PAR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD
$PAR
Given \(F_{wall} = \mu m g \),
the coefficient of friction required between the hooves and the ground is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \mu = \frac{ F_{wall} }{ mg }
  = \frac{ $Fwall }{ $w } = $coef_friction \)


$PAR $HR $PAR
$BBOLD $BITALIC Bonus: $EITALIC $EBOLD
Can you show that the angle and coefficient of friction values
can be calculated independent of mass?
