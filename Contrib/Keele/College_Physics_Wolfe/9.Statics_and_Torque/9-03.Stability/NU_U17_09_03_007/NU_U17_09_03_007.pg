$PAR
Suppose the weight of the drawbridge in the above figure is supported entirely by its hinges
and the opposite shore, so that its cables are slack.

$PAR
a) What fraction of the weight is supported by the opposite shore if the point of support
is directly beneath the cable attachments?
$PAR
ratio = \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) What is the direction and magnitude of the force the hinges exert on the bridge under these circumstances?
The mass of the bridge is \($m\).

$PAR

\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Taking the hinge as the pivot, the ratio of the forces is
the ratio of the two lengths \( \frac{1.5}{9} = $ratio \)
$PAR
The force is
\( F = m g \frac{7.5}{9} = ($m)($g) \frac{7.5}{9} = $F \)
$PAR
Because the cable is slack, there is no horizontal component \((T = 0)\)
meaning that \(F\) is entirely vertical and \( \theta = $angle^{\circ} \).
