$PAR
A gymnast is attempting to perform splits.
From the information given in the above figure,
calculate the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on each foot by the floor
if her weight, \(w = $w\).
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the ground

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
The total force exerted by the ground acts parallel to the gymnast's legs.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The force applied by each foot vertically must be equal and opposite to her weight.
\( F_V = \frac{w}{2} = \frac{$w}{2} = $Fvertical \)
$PAR
The force is applied perpendicular to the leg. Taking the leg as the hypotenuse,
we have \( \frac{F_H}{F_V} = \rm \frac{0.90 \ m }{0.30 \ m} \),
so \( F_H = 3 \times F_V = $Fhorizontal \).
$PAR
The force is the vector addition of the two components
\( F = \sqrt{ F_H^2 + F_V^2 } = \sqrt{ ($Fhorizontal)^2 + ($Fvertical)^2 } = $Ftotal \)
$PAR
and the angle is given by
\( \displaystyle \tan \theta
  = \frac{F_V}{F_H}
  = \frac{$Fvertical}{$Fhorizontal}
\)
$PAR
so, \( \theta = $theta^{\circ} \)
