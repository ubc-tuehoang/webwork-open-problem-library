$PAR
Suppose the weight of the drawbridge in the above figure is supported entirely by its hinges
and the opposite shore, so that its cables are slack.

$PAR
a) What fraction of the weight is supported by the opposite shore if the point of support
is directly beneath the cable attachments?
$PAR
ratio = \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.

$PAR
b) What is the direction and magnitude of the force the hinges exert on the bridge under these circumstances?
The mass of the bridge is \($mbridge\).

$PAR

\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis

$PAR
c)
Suppose a \($mcar\) car parks on the \($mbridge\) bridge in the above figure
with its center of mass halfway between the hinges and the cable attachments.
(The bridge is supported by the cables and hinges only. Note that the diagram
only shows one cable, but there are two cables, one on each side of the bridge's "bed.")
$PAR
a) Find the tension in each of the two cables.
$PAR
\( T = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
At minimum, how many cables affix the drawbridge to the winch on the left side of the figure?
What is the tension in each cable?

d) Find the direction of the force exerted by the hinges on the bridge
while the car is parked on it.

\( \theta = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Taking the hinge as the pivot, the ratio of the forces is
the ratio of the two lengths \( \frac{1.5}{9} = $ratio \)
$PAR
(b)
The force is
\( F = m g \frac{7.5}{9} = ($mbridge)($g) \frac{7.5}{9} = $F \)
$PAR
Because the cable is slack, there is no horizontal component \((T = 0)\)
meaning that \(F\) is entirely vertical and \( \theta = $angle^{\circ} \).


$PAR $BBOLD With a car parked halfway on the bridge $EBOLD $PAR
(c)
The total tension is given by
$PAR
\( \displaystyle T_{total}
  = \frac{g}{l \sin $alpha^{\circ}} ( m_{bridge} ($dcombridge) + m_{car} \frac{l}{2} ) \\
  = \frac{$g}{$length \sin $alpha^{\circ}} ( ($mbridge) ($dcombridge) + ($mcar) \frac{$length}{2} )
  = $Ttotal
\)
$PAR
For each cable \(T = $Ttotal/2\)

$PAR
(d)
Given that the forces sum to zero vectorally,
we find the vertical and horizontal components of \(F\)
to deduce the angle from \( \tan \theta = \frac{ F_{vertical} }{ F_{horizontal} } \).
$PAR
\( F_{vertical} = g \, (m_{bridge} + m_{car}) - T \sin $alpha^{\circ} \\
  = $g ($mbridge + $mcar) - $Ttotal (\sin $alpha^{\circ})
  = \{$FV->value\} \ \rm N
\)
$PAR
\( F_{horizontal} = T (\cos $alpha^{\circ})
  = $Ttotal (\cos $alpha^{\circ})
  = $FH \ \rm N
\)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \tan \theta = \frac{ \{$FV->value\} }{ $FH } \)
$PAR
\( \theta = $gamma ^{\circ} \)
