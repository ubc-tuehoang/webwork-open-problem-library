$PAR
a) Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in the figure above. Calculate the force exerted on
the wall assuming that force is horizontal. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal and
opposite to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. The total mass of
the horse and rider is \($m\).
$PAR
\( F_{wall} = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium.
Given that the horse is motionless in the vertical direction,
to what must the upwardly-directed normal force be equal?
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on each foot of the horse in
the above figure (two are on the ground), assuming the centre of mass of the horse is
midway between the feet. The total mass of the horse and rider is \($m\).

$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the vertical (wall)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given that the centre of mass is midway between its feet, what fraction of the horse's weight will each hoof support?
What then can be said about the normal force on each foot, and in turn, about the force of static friction?
You will need to use the second condition for static equilibrium to first work out the force exerted by the wall.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) What is the minimum coefficient of friction between the hooves and ground? Note that the force exerted by the wall is horizontal.
$PAR
\( \mu = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for static friction at its maximum.
For the horse not to move laterally, all horizontal forces must balance.
END_HINT


BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

a) To balance the torques, \( F_{wall} \times $rwall = w \times $rhorse \)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_{wall} = \frac{ ($m)($g) \times $rhorse }{ $rwall } = $Fwall \)

$PAR
b) Now, it's just a matter of vector addition of the forces.
The magnitude of the force balancing the two forces is given by
\( F = \sqrt{ (m g)^2 + F_{wall}^2 } \)
$PAR
For each hoof, divide this by two to get
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F
  = \frac{ \sqrt{ (m g)^2 + F_{wall}^2 } }{ 2 }
  = \frac{ \sqrt{ ($m \times $g)^2 + $Fwall^2 } }{ 2 }
  = $F
\)

$PAR
The angle is given by
\( \displaystyle \tan \theta = \frac{ F_{wall} }{ mg } \)
$PAR
so take the arctan to get \( \theta = $degrees^{\circ} \)

$PAR
c) Given \(F_{wall} = \mu m g \),
the coefficient of friction required between the hooves and the ground is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \mu = \frac{ F_{wall} }{ mg }
  = \frac{ $Fwall }{ $w } = $coef_friction \)


$PAR $HR $PAR
$BBOLD $BITALIC Bonus: $EITALIC $EBOLD
Can you show that the angle and coefficient of friction values
can be calculated independent of mass?
