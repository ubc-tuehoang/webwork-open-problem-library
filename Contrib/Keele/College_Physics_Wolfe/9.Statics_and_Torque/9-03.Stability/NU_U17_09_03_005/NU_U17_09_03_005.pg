$PAR
A \(h = $h\)-high and \($l\)-long wall under construction and its bracing are shown in the figure above.
The wall is in stable equilibrium without the bracing but can pivot at its base.
Calculate the force exerted by each of the \($N\) braces if a strong wind
exerts a horizontal force of \($FA\) on each square metre of the wall.
Assume that the net force from the wind acts at a height halfway up the wall,
assume that the braces are all attached halfway up the wall,
and assume that all braces exert equal forces parallel to their lengths.
Neglect the thickness of the wall.
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
Be careful - the braces exert a force "parallel to their length."
Furthermore, the force exerted by the wind is in terms of $BITALIC pressure $EITALIC - force per unit area.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The total force of the wind on the wall is the wind pressure times the area of the wall
\( F_{wind} = P \times h \times l
  = $FA / \rm \ m^2 \times $h \times $l
  = $Fwind
\)
$PAR
Each brace acting at an angle of \(35^{\circ}\) needs to supply a force
\( \displaystyle F = \frac{ F_{wind} } { $N \times \sin 35^{\circ} }
  = \frac{ $Fwind } { $N \times \sin 35^{\circ} }
  = $FB
\)
