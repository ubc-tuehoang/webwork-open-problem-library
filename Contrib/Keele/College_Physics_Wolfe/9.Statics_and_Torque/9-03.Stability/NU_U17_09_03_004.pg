A person carries a plank of wood \($d\) long with one hand pushing down on it at one end
with a force \(F_1\) and the other hand holding it up with a force of \(F_2\)
applied at a distance of \($r2\) from the same end of the plank.
The plank has a mass of \($m1\) and its centre of gravity is at the middle of the plank.
$PAR
a) What is the force \(F_1\)?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) What is the force \(F_2\)?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Using \( d = $d\) and \(r = $r2\),
choose the pivot at the hand holding the plank up so that
\( F_1 r = m g \ (d/2 - r) \)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F_1
  = \frac{ m g \ ( d/2 - r ) }{ r }
  = \frac{ ($m1) ($g) ( $r1 - $r2 ) }{ $r2 }
  = $F1
\)
$PAR
The upwards force must be equal to the sum of the downward forces
$PAR
\( F_2 = F_1 + m g
  = $F1 + $m1 \times $g
  = $F2
\)
