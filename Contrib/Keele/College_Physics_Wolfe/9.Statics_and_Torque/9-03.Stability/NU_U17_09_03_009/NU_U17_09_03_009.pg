$PAR

A sandwich board advertising sign is constructed as shown in the above figure. The sign's
mass is \($m\).

$PAR

a) Calculate the tension in the chain assuming no friction between the legs and the sidewalk.
$PAR
\( T = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Isolate one board of the sign and begin with the second condition for static equilibrium.
Given that the total mass of the sign is \($m\), what then is the mass of one board?
The normal force exerted on one board?
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) What force is exerted by each side on the hinge?
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
Given that the forces exerted by the hinge are internal, action-reaction pairs,
it may be again easiest to consider one board of the sign only.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Take the height \(h = $h\), the distance between the legs \(d = $d\)
and distance from the chain to the hinge \(b = $b\)
with the mass \(m = $m\).
$PAR
After taking the hinge as our pivot and resolving the components of the moments
of the tension, the weight and the normal force on one board, we end up with
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \frac{m g h}{4} = T \, b \, \frac{2 h}{d} \)
$PAR
which gives
\( \displaystyle T = \frac{m g d}{8 b}
  = \frac{($m) ($g) ($d)}{8 \times $b}
  = $T
\)
$PAR
(if you had difficulty getting that, then remember that
\( \tan \theta = \frac{ \sin \theta }{ \cos \theta } \)
and use
\( \tan \theta = \frac{2h}{d} \)
to get rid of the trigonometric functions
)
$PAR
Since the mass and the normal force act vertically,
the force on the hinge is equal and opposite to the tension
in the chain \( F = T = $F \)
