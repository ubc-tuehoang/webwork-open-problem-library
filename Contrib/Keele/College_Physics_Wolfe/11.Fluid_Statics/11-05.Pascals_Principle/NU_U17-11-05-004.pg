BEGIN_TEXT

A certain hydraulic system is designed to exert a force \($force\) times as large as the one put into it.
$PAR
a) What must be the ratio of the area of the slave cylinder to the area of the master cylinder?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
b) What must be the ratio of their diameters?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
c) By what factor is the distance through which the output force moves reduced
relative to the distance through which the input force moves?
Assume no losses to friction.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
a) Equate pressures of master and slave cylinders, then rearrange,
$PAR
b) Remember if variable is squared, you must take its square root.
$PAR
c) Equate work done for master and slave cylinders.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

For a force \($force\) times bigger:
$PAR
a) the ratio of the areas is \($ratio_area\)
$PAR
b) the ratio of the diameters is \( \sqrt{ $force } = $ratio_diameter\)
$PAR
a) the reduction of the distance is \( \frac{1}{$force} = $distance_reduction\)
