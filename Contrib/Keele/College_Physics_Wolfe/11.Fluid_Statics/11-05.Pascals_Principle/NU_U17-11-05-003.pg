A crass host pours the remnants of several bottles of wine into a jug after a party.
He then inserts a cork with a \($d1\) diameter into the bottle,
placing it in direct contact with the wine.
He is amazed when he pounds the cork into place and the bottom of the jug
(with a \($d2\) diameter) breaks away.
Calculate the extra force exerted against the bottom if he pounded the cork
with a \($force_top\) force.

$PAR
\( F_{extra} = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}


END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the question asks for the difference between the two forces.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( \displaystyle F_{extra} = F \left(\frac{d_{bottom}}{d_{top}} \right)^2 - F
  = $force_top \left( \frac{$d2}{$d1} \right)^2 - $force_top
  = $force_extra
\)
$PAR
Remember to subtract the original force from the calculation to find the
difference between the forces.
