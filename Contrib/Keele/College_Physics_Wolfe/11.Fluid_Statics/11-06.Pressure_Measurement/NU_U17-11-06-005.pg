Suppose you measure a standing person's blood pressure
by placing the cuff on his leg \(0.500 \, \rm m\) below the heart.
Calculate the pressure you would observe (in units of \(\textrm{mm Hg}\))
if the pressure at the heart were \($P1\)  over \($P2\) \(\textrm{mm Hg}\).
Assume that there is no loss of pressure due to resistance in the circulatory system
(a reasonable assumption, since major arteries are large).
The density of blood is equal to \($density\).

BEGIN_HINT
What is the change in pressure in \(\textrm{mm Hg}\)?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The change in pressure due to the column of blood is
\( P_{leg} = h \rho g = ($h)($density)($g) ( \frac{1 \textrm{mm Hg}}{$Pa_per_mmHg \ \rm Pa} )
  = $P_leg
\)
$PAR
Adding that pressure to the values found at the heart to get
an observed pressure at the leg of \($P1_obs\) over \($P2_obs \ \textrm{mm Hg}\)
