BEGIN_TEXT

A submarine is stranded on the bottom of the ocean with its hatch \($hatch\) below the surface.
Calculate the force needed to open the hatch from the inside,
given it is circular and \($d\) in diameter.
Air pressure inside the submarine is \(1.00 \, \textrm{atm}\).
The density of salt water is \($density\).
$PAR
\( F = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the pressure attributed to salt water at this depth.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

With the pressure in the submarine at \($pressure\),
you only need to calculate the pressure due to the column of sea water.
$PAR
\( \displaystyle F = h \rho g A
  = ($hatch)($density)($g) \pi \left( \frac{$d}{2} \right)^2
  = $force
\)
