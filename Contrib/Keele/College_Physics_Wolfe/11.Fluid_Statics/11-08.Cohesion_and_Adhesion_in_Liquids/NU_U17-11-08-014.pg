BEGIN_TEXT

What is the ratio of heights to which ethyl alcohol and water are raised
by capillary action in the same glass tube?
The surface tension of ethyl alcohol is equal to \($tension_ethyl\),
the density is equal to \($density_ethyl\) and the contact angle is equal to \(0\) degrees.
$PAR
ratio = \{ans_rule(40)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Use the textbook to find surface tension of water.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Since the contact angle for both liquids is \(0^{\circ}\),
\( \displaystyle h \propto \frac{\gamma}{\rho} \)
$PAR
the ratio of heights is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle
  = \frac{\gamma_{ethyl} \rho_{water}}{\gamma_{water} \rho_{ethyl}}
  = \frac{($tension_ethyl) ($density_water)}{($tension_water) ($density_ethyl)}
  = $ratio
\)
