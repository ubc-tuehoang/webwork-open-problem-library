BEGIN_TEXT

Calculate the ratio of the heights to which water and mercury are raised
by capillary action in the same glass tube.
The surface tension of water is equal to \($tension_water\).
The surface tension of mercury is equal to \($tension_Hg\).
The density of mercury is equal to \($density_Hg\).
The contact angle for mercury is \($theta_Hg\) degrees.
$PAR
ratio = \{ans_rule(20)\}

BEGIN_HINT
You should be able to divide out radius and gravity from your ratio,

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

With
\( \displaystyle h \propto \frac{\gamma \cos \theta}{\rho} \)
and the other quantities are the same for both fluids,
$PAR
the ratio of heights is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle
  = \frac{\gamma_{water} \cos \theta_{water} \rho_{Hg}}{\gamma_{Hg} \cos \theta_{Hg} \rho_{water}}
  = \frac{($tension_water)(\cos 0^{\circ})($density_Hg)}{($tension_Hg)(\cos $theta_Hg^{\circ})($density_water)}
  = $ratio
\)
