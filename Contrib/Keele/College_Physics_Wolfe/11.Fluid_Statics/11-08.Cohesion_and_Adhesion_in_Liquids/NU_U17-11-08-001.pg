BEGIN_TEXT

What is the pressure inside an alveolus having a radius of \($r\)
if the surface tension of the fluid-lined wall is the same as for soapy water (\($tension)\)?
You may assume the pressure is the same as that created by a spherical bubble.
$PAR
\( P = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the relationship between pressure and surface tension, \(\gamma\).
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Surface tension is given by \( \displaystyle \gamma = \frac{F}{L} \)
$PAR
Pressure inside a spherical bubble is \( \displaystyle P = \frac{4 \gamma}{r} \)
where \(r\) is the radius of the bubble.
$PAR
\( \displaystyle P = 4 \times \frac{$tension}{$r} = $pressure \)
