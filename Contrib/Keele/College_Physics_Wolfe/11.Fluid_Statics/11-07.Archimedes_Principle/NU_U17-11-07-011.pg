a) What is the density of a woman who floats in freshwater with \($percent\%\)
of her volume above the surface?
This could be measured by placing her in a tank with marks on the side to measure
how much water she displaces when floating and when held under water (briefly).
$PAR
\( \rho = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
b) What percent of her volume is above the surface when she floats in seawater?
The density of sea water is \($density_sea\).
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20)\} \(\%\)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider how much water is displaced.

a)
$PAR
\( \rho = $density_fresh \times (1 - \frac{$percent}{100}) = $density \)
$PAR
b)
$PAR
Percent of the volume above the surface when she floats in seawater
\( \displaystyle
  = \left(1 - \frac{$density}{$density_sea}\right) \times 100\%
  = $percent_sea \%
