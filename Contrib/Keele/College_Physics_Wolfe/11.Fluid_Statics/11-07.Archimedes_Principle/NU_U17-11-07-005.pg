BEGIN_TEXT

Bird bones have air pockets in them to reduce their weightâ€”this also gives them
an average density significantly less than that of the bones of other animals.
Suppose an ornithologist weighs a bird bone in air and in water and finds
its mass is \($mass\) and its apparent mass
when submerged is \($mass2\) (the bone is watertight).
$PAR
a) What mass of water is displaced?
$PAR
\( m = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
b) What is the volume of the bone?
$PAR
\( V = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
c) What is its average density?
$PAR
\( \rho = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Part c requires use of values from both the bird and the water displaced.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

a)
$PAR
\( m = $mass - $mass2 = $mass_water \)
$PAR
b)
$PAR
\( V = $mass_water \div $density_water = $volume_bone \)
$PAR
c)
$PAR
\( \rho = $mass \div $volume_bone = $density_bone \)
