BEGIN_TEXT

A \($mass\) man floats in freshwater with \($percent \%\)
of his volume above water when his lungs are empty, and \($percent2 \%\)
of his volume above water when his lungs are full.
Calculate the volume of air he inhales—called his lung capacity—in liters.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{L}\)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the difference in volume of his lungs between inhalation and exhalation.
