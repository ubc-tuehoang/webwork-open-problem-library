BEGIN_TEXT

Scurrilous con artists have been known to represent gold-plated tungsten ingots as pure gold
and sell them to the greedy at prices much below gold value but deservedly far above the cost of tungsten.
With what accuracy must you be able to measure the mass of such an ingot in and out of water
to tell that it is almost pure tungsten rather than pure gold?
The density of gold and tungsten out of water are respectively \($d_gold_out\) and \($d_tung_out\).
The densities of gold and tungsten in water are respectively \($d_gold_in\) and \($d_tung_in\).
$PAR
Out of water = \{ans_rule(15)\} \(\%\)
$PAR
In water = \{ans_rule(15)\} \(\%\)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
What is the difference in their densities?

a) Accuracy required out of water
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \frac{$d_gold_out - $d_tung_out}{$d_gold_out} \times 100\% = $accuracy_out \% \)
$PAR
b) Accuracy required in water
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \frac{$d_gold_in - $d_tung_in}{$d_gold_in} \times 100\% = $accuracy_in \% \)
