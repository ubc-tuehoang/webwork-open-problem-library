BEGIN_TEXT

As a woman walks, her entire weight is momentarily placed on one heel of her high-heeled shoes.
Calculate the pressure exerted on the floor by the heel
if it has an area of \($area\) and the woman's mass is \($mass\).
(In the early days of commercial flight, women were not allowed to wear high-heeled shoes
because aircraft floors were too thin to withstand such large pressures.)

$PAR
\( P = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the gravitational force.
