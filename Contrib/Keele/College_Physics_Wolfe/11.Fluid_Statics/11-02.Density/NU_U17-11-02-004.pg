BEGIN_TEXT

A straightforward method of finding the density of an object is to measure its mass
and then measure its volume by submerging it in a graduated cylinder.
What is the density of a \($mass\) rock that displaces \($volume\) of water?
(Note that the accuracy and practical applications of this technique are more limited
than a variety of others that are based on Archimedes' principle.)
$PAR
\( \rho = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Consider relationship between volume, mass, and density.
