BEGIN_TEXT

There is relatively little empty space between atoms in solids and liquids,
so that the average density of an atom is about the same as matter on a macroscopic scaleâ€”approximately \(10^{3} \, \rm kg/m^3 \).
The nucleus of an atom has a radius about \(10^{-15}\) that of the atom
and contains nearly all the mass of the entire atom.
What is the approximate density of a nucleus?
$PAR
b) One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus.
What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun
(the radius of the Sun is \(7 \times 10^{8} \, \rm m\))?
The mass of the sun is equal to \(1.99 \times 10^{30} \, \rm kg\).

$PAR
a)
\( \rho = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
b)
\( m = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
a) Remember that the mass of the atom is approximately equal to the mass of the nucleus.
In addition, the radius of the nucleus is 10<sup>-5</sup> times the radius of the atom.
Use this knowledge to develop a relationship between the densities of the atom and the nucleus.
$PAR
b) Use the density found in part (a). Consider the volume of a sphere.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The volume of a sphere is
\( \displaystyle V = \frac{4 \pi r^3}{3} \)
$PAR
With \( \rho = $density_nucleus \),
$PAR
\( \displaystyle r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{3 M_{sun}}{4 \pi \rho} } = $radius_ns \)
