BEGIN_TEXT

The planet Pluto and its Moon Charon are separated by \(19,600 \, \rm km\).
Neglecting atmospheric effects,
at what distance will the \($D\) diameter Mount Palomar telescope
be able to resolve these bodies when they are \(4.50 \times 10^9 \, \rm km\) from Earth?
Assume an average wavelength of \($wavelength\).
$PAR
The telescope should be able to discern a separation at : \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Is the telescope's ability to resolve more closely related to how far the bodies are from the telescope itself,
or how far the bodies are from each other?
END_HINT

\( \displaystyle x = 1.22 \ \frac{d \lambda}{D}
  = 1.22 \ \frac{($d)($wavelength)}{$D}
