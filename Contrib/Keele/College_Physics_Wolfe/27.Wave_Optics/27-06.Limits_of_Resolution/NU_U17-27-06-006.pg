The limit to the eye's acuity is actually related to diffraction by the pupil.

$PAR
a) What is the angle between two just-resolvable points of light for a \($D\) diameter pupil,
assuming an average wavelength of \($wavelength\)?
$PAR
\( \theta = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} (use "deg" for degrees and "rad" for radians)

$PAR
b) Take your result to be the practical limit for the eye.
What is the greatest possible distance a car can be from you if you can resolve its two headlights,
given they are \(1.30 \, \rm m\) apart?
$PAR
\( d = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
c) What is the distance between two just-resolvable points held
at an arm's length of \(0.800 \, \rm m\) from your eye?
$PAR
\( x = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}
