BEGIN_TEXT

Diffraction spreading for a flashlight is insignificant compared with other limitations in its optics,
such as spherical aberrations in its mirror.
To show this, calculate the minimum angular spreading of a flashlight beam
that is originally \($D\) in diameter with an average wavelength of \($wavelength\).
$PAR
\( \theta = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} (use "deg" for degrees and "rad" for radians)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
How are angle \(\theta\) and wavelength \(\lambda\) related in this question?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( \displaystyle \theta = 1.22 \ \frac{\lambda}{D}
  = 1.22 \ \frac{$wavelength}{$D}
  = $theta
\)
