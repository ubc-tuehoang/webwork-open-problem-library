$PAR
The figure above shows a double slit located a distance \(x\) from a screen,
with the distance from the centre of the screen given by \(y\).
When the distance \(d\) between the slits is relatively large,
there will be numerous bright spots, called fringes.
Show that, for small angles (where \(\sin \theta\)) is approximately equal to \(\theta\),
with \(\theta\) in radians), the distance between fringes
is given by \(\Delta y = x \lambda d\).
$PAR
For small angles \(\sin \theta = \tan \theta = \theta\)
$PAR
For two adjacent fringes, enter \(\lambda\) as \(w\) and \(m\) as \(m\);
$PAR
\(d \sin \theta_m = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
\(d \sin \theta_{m+1} = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Subtracting the two equations gives;
$PAR
\(d (\sin \theta_{m+1} - \sin \theta_m) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
\(d (\theta_{m+1} - \theta_m) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Entering \(x\) and \(y\) as their respective side lengths,
\(\tan \theta_m = \) = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
\(\lambda\) = \{ans_rule(20)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

For small angles \(\sin \theta = \tan \theta \approx \theta\) (in radians).
$PAR
For two adjacent fringes, we have
\(d \sin \theta_m = m \lambda\) and
\(d \sin \theta_{m+1} = (m + 1) \lambda\).
$PAR
Subtracting these equations gives
$PAR
\(d (\sin \theta_{m+1} - \sin \theta_m) = [(m+1) - m] \lambda\)
$PAR
\(d (\theta_{m+1} - \theta_m) = \lambda\)

$PAR
\( \displaystyle \tan \theta_m
  = \frac{y_m}{x} \approx \theta_m
  \Rightarrow d \left( \frac{y_{m+1}}{x} - \frac{y_m}{x} \right)
  = \lambda
\)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle d \frac{\Delta y}{x}
  = \lambda
  \Rightarrow \Delta y
  = \frac{x \lambda}{d}
\)
