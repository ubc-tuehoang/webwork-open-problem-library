BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you put on two pairs of Polaroid sunglasses with their axes at an angle of \($angle^{\circ}\).
How much longer will it take the light to deposit a given amount of energy in your eye
compared with a single pair of sunglasses?
Assume the lenses are clear except for their polarizing characteristics.

BEGIN_HINT
Express the ratios of intensity in terms of time,
where the time corresponding to initial intensity would be less than time required for the second intensity.
