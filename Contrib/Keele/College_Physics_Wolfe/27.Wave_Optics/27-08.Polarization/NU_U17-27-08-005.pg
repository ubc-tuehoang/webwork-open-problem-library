BEGIN_TEXT

The intensity of polarized light is reduced to \(90.0 \, \%\) of its original value
by passing through a polarizing filter with its axis at an angle of
\($angle^{\circ}\) to the direction of polarization. Verify this statement.
$PAR
Enter the equivalence statement.
If you need to raise \(\cos \theta\) to an exponent, put the entire term in parentheses.
Enter angle \(\theta\) as "\(x\)".
$PAR
\( \displaystyle \frac{I}{I_0} = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR
Now substitute an angle of \($angle^{\circ}\) into the expression above
(recall that WebWork evaluates in radians);
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Express this value as a percent with two significant figures;
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20)\} %

BEGIN_HINT
How do you find the intensity of light which has passed through a polarizing filter?
