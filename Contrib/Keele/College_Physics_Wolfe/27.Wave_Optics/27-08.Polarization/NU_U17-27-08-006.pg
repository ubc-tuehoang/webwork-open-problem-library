BEGIN_TEXT

Show that if you have three polarizing filters, with the second at an angle of
\(45^\circ\) to the first and the third at an angle of \(90^\circ\) to the first,
the intensity of light passed by the first will be reduced to \(25 \%\) of its value.
(This is in contrast to having only the first and third, which reduces the intensity to zero,
so that placing the second between them increases the intensity of the transmitted light.)
$PAR
First, write expressions for \(I_1\) and \(I_2\).
Enter \(I_0\) as \(\rm I\), enter \(I_1\) as \(\rm i\).
Enter \(\theta\) as \(\rm x\) for the first angle, and as \(\rm y\) for the second angle.
If \(\cos (x)\) must be raised to an exponent, enclose the entire expression in parentheses.
At the moment, you are only entering formulas, $BBOLD do not $EBOLD substitute values.
$PAR
\(I_1 = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
\(I_2 = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
Combine the two above expressions;
$PAR
\(I_2 = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Now substitute values into the equation above;
$PAR
\(I_2 = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

BEGIN_HINT
The last part of the question asks for a formula which includes a constant.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\(I_1 = I_0 \cos^2 x\)
$PAR
\(I_2 = I_1 \cos^2 y\)

$PAR
Combine the two above expressions;
$PAR
\(I_2 = I_0 \cos^2 (x) \cos^2 (y) \)
$PAR
Now substitute values into the equation above;
$PAR
\( \displaystyle I_2 = \frac{I_0}{4} \)
