BEGIN_TEXT

A film of soapy water (\(n = $index\)) on top of a plastic cutting board
has a thickness of \($thick\).
What wavelength is most strongly reflected if it is illuminated perpendicular to its surface?
$PAR
\( \lambda = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
As the wave transverses through these media how many phase shifts will it incur?
END_HINT
