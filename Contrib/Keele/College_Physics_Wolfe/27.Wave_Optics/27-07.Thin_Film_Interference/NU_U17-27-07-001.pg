BEGIN_TEXT

A soap bubble is \($thick\) thick and illuminated by white light incident perpendicular to its surface.
What wavelength and color of visible light is most constructively reflected,
assuming the same index of refraction as water (\($index\))?
$PAR
\( \lambda = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
What occurs when a wavelength passes through a medium which is of a higher refractive index than the medium it came from?
Does this occur here?
How does it affect the constructiveness of the reflection?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( \lambda = 4 n t_c = 4 \times $index \times $thick = $wavelength \)
