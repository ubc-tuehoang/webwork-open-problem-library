BEGIN_TEXT

A film of oil on water will appear dark when it is very thin,
because the path length difference becomes small compared with the wavelength of light
and there is a phase shift at the top surface.
If it becomes dark when the path length difference is less than one-fourth the wavelength,
what is the thickest the oil can be and appear dark at all visible wavelengths?
Oil has an index of refraction of \(1.40\).
$PAR
\( t = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the thickness of oil is equal to half of the path length (due to reflection).
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The shortest wavelength of visible light is \($wavelength\)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle t = \frac{\lambda}{8 n}
  = \frac{$wavelength}{8 \times $index}
  = $thick
