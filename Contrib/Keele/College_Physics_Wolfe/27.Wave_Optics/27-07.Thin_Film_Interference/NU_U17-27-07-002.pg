BEGIN_TEXT

An oil slick on water is \($thick\) thick and illuminated by white light
incident perpendicular to its surface.
What color does the oil appear (what is the most constructively reflected wavelength),
given its index of refraction is \(1.40\)?
$PAR
\( \lambda = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the index of refraction, would you expect a phase change to occur?
