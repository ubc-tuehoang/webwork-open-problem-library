BEGIN_TEXT

As a soap bubble thins it becomes dark, because the path length difference becomes small
compared with the wavelength of light and there is a phase shift at the top surface.
If it becomes dark when the path length difference is less than one-fourth the wavelength,
what is the thickest the bubble can be and appear dark at all visible wavelengths?
Assume the same index of refraction as water \($index\).
$PAR
\( t = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Do dark areas occur during constructive or destructive interference?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Since the longest visible wavelength is \($wavelength\)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle t = \frac{\lambda}{4 n}
  = \frac{$wavelength}{4 \times $index}
  = $thick
\)
