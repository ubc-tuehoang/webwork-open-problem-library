BEGIN_TEXT

What is the index of refraction of a material for which the wavelength of light is \($a\) times its value in a vacuum?
$PAR
\( \eta = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
How would you find wavelength when a substance is entering a substance of higher refractive index.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( \displaystyle \eta = \frac{1}{$a} = $index \)
