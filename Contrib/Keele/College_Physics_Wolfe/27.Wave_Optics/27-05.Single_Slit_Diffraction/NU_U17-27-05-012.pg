BEGIN_TEXT

A double slit produces a diffraction pattern that is a combination of single and double slit interference.
Find the ratio of the width of the slits to the separation between them,
if the first minimum of the single slit pattern falls on the fifth maximum of the double slit pattern.
(This will greatly reduce the intensity of the fifth maximum.)
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the relationship between \(D\) and \(d\).
