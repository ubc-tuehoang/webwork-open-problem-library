BEGIN_TEXT

A proton and an antiproton collide head-on, with each having
a kinetic energy of \($TeV \, \rm TeV\) (such as in the LHC at CERN).
How much collision energy is available,
taking into account the annihilation of the two masses?
(Note that this is not significantly greater
than the extremely relativistic kinetic energy.)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{TeV}\)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Remember the kinetic energy given in the problem is pertinent to both the proton and the antiproton.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

Each particle has a kinetic energy of \($TeV \, \rm TeV\)
plus its rest energy of \($mc \, \rm MeV\).
$PAR
\(E_{total} = 2 \times \rm ($TeV \, TeV + $mc \, MeV) = $Energy \, TeV \)
