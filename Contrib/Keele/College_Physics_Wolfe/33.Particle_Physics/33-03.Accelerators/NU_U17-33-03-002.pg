BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose a \(W^-\) created in a bubble chamber lives for \($time\).
What distance does it move in this time if it is traveling at \($velocity \, \rm c\)?
Since this distance is too short to make a track,
the presence of the \(W^-\) must be inferred from its decay products.
$PAR
Note that the time is longer than the given \(W^-\) lifetime,
which can be due to the statistical nature of decay or time dilation.
$PAR
\( d = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} \(\textrm{fm}\)

BEGIN_HINT
It may be useful to recall kinematics formulae.
