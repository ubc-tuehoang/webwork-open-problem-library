The intensity of cosmic ray radiation decreases rapidly with increasing energy,
but there are occasionally extremely energetic cosmic rays that create a shower of radiation
from all the particles they create by striking a nucleus in the atmosphere as seen in the figure given below.
Suppose a cosmic ray particle having an energy of \(10^{10} \, \rm GeV\) converts its energy
into particles with masses averaging \($mass\) \(\textrm{GeV/c}^2\).
$PAR
a) How many particles are created?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
b) If the particles rain down on a \($area\) area, how many particles are there per square meter?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{particles/m}^2\)

An extremely energetic cosmic ray creates a show of particles on earth.
The energy of these rare cosmic rays can approach a joule (about \(10^{10} \, \rm GeV\))
and, after multiple collisions, huge numbers of particles are created from this energy.
Cosmic ray showers have been observed to extend over may square kilometers.
