Accelerators such as the Triangle Universities Meson Facility
(\{ htmlLink( 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIUMF', 'TRIUMF', "TARGET='_blank'" ) \}) in British Columbia
produce secondary beams of pions by having an intense primary proton beam strike a target.
Such "meson factories" have been used for many years to study
the interaction of pions with nuclei and, hence, the strong nuclear force.
One reaction that occurs is \(\pi^{+} + p \rightarrow \Delta^{+{+}} \rightarrow \pi^{+} + p\),
where the \(\Delta^{+{+}}\) is a very short-lived particle.
The graph in below shows the probability of this reaction as a function of energy.
In this experiment, the width of the bump was measured to be approximately \($energy\)
and is the uncertainty in energy due to the short lifetime of the \(\Delta^{+{+}}\).

$PAR

(a) Find this lifetime.
$PAR
\( t = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b) Verify from the quark composition of the particles that this reaction annihilates
and then re-creates a \(d\) quark and an antiquark by writing the reaction and decay in terms of quarks.
Enter \(u\) for up quark, and \(w\) for it's antiparticle.
Enter \(d\) for down quark, and \(D\) for it's antiparticle.
$PAR

\(\pi^{+}(uD) + p(uud) \rightarrow \Delta^{+{+}}(uuu) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\)
(\{ans_rule(10)\}) + \(p\) (\{ans_rule(10)\})

BEGIN_HINT
Use the graph to find energy. Can you relate this value to lifespan?
