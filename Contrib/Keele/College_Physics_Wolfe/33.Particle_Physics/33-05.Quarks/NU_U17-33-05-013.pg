BEGIN_TEXT

Three quarks form a baryon. How many combinations of the six known quarks are
there if all combinations are possible?
$PAR
\( N = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall that baryons can also consist of combinations of antiquarks,
therefore your answer should be less than the known number of baryons.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The three quarks in a baryon can each be one of the six quarks.
$PAR
\( N = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = $combination \)
