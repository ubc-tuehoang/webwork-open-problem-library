BEGIN_TEXT

There are particles called D-mesons.
One of them is the \(\rm D^+\) meson, which has a single positive charge and
a baryon number of zero, also the value of its strangeness, topness, and bottomness.
It has a charm of \(+1\). What is its quark configuration?
$PAR
Charm = \(c\); anticharm = \(C\); down = \(d\); antidown = \(D\);
$PAR

\(\textrm{D}^+\) = \{ans_rule(10)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
If strangeness, topness, and bottomness are eliminated, what options do you have left?
Which option do you think is more appropriate? Why?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The quark configuration of the meson is
\( \rm{D}^+ = c \overline{d} \)
(charm anti-down).

$PAR
\( Q = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = +1 \)
$PAR
\( B = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{-1}{3} = 0 \)
$PAR
\( C = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
$PAR
\( S,T,B' = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
