BEGIN_TEXT

There are particles called bottom mesons or B-mesons.
One of them is the \(\rm B^-\) meson, which has a single negative charge;
its baryon number is zero, as are its strangeness, charm, and topness.
It has a bottomness of \(-1\). What is its quark configuration?
$PAR
Bottom = \(b\); antibottom = \(B\); up = \(u\); antiup = \(w\)
$PAR
\(\rm B^-\) = \{ans_rule(10)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the net charge. Which quark must be used to obtain this value?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The quark configuration of the meson is
\( \rm{B}^- = b \overline{u} \)
(bottom anti-up).

$PAR
\( Q = \frac{-1}{3} + \frac{-2}{3} = -1 \)
$PAR
\( B = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{-1}{3} = 0 \)
$PAR
\( B' = -1 + 0 = -1 \)
$PAR
\( S,T,C = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
