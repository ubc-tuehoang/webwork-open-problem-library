BEGIN_TEXT

A shopper standing \($object_distance\) from a convex security mirror
sees his image with a magnification of \($magnification\).
$PAR
a) Where is his image?
$PAR
\( d_i = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange one of the formul&3230; for magnification to solve for the image distance?
END_HINT
BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) What is the focal length of the mirror?
$PAR
\( f = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for focal length?
END_HINT
BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
c) What is its radius of curvature?
$PAR
\( r = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
By what integer must you multiply a mirror's focal length to obtain its radius of curvature?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( d_i = - m d_o = - $magnification \times $object_distance = $image_distance \)
