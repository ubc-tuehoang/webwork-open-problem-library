$BBOLD Integrated Concepts:$EBOLD
Calculate the intensity of infrared radiation projected by the concave mirror
of an electric heater on a person \($image_distance\) away.
Assume that the mirror has a radius of curvature of \($radius_of_curvature\),
the heating element radiates \($power\) and has an area of \($surface_area1\),
and that half of the radiated power is reflected and focused by the mirror.
$PAR
\( I = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Can you first rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for the object distance (the distance from the heating coils to the mirror?
How then can you determine the surface area at the object distance? Recall the definition of average intensity.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

From the problem text, the power reflected and focused by the mirror is
$BR
\( P_r = P \div 2 = \frac{$power}{2} = $power_reflected \)
$PAR
The focal length is half the radius of curvature
$BR
\( \displaystyle f = \frac{r}{2} = \frac{$radius_of_curvature}{2} = $focal_length \)
$PAR
To find the magnification, we need to find the distance to the heating element, \(d_o\)
$PAR
\( \displaystyle d_o = \frac{f d_i}{d_i - f}
  = \frac{($focal_length)($image_distance)}{$image_distance - $focal_length}
  = $object_distance
\)
$PAR
The magnification is
\( \displaystyle m = - \frac{d_i}{d_o}
  = - \frac{$image_distance}{$object_distance}
  = $magnification
\)
$PAR
The surface area projected by the mirror on the person is
\( A_r = \left| m A \right| = \left| $magnification \times $surface_area1 \right|
  = $surface_area2
\)
$PAR
Therefore the intensity of the infrared radiation reflected onto the person is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle I = \frac{P_r}{A_r}
  = \frac{$power_reflected}{$surface_area2}
  = $intensity2
\)
