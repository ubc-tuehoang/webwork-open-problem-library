BEGIN_TEXT

There was a major collision of an asteroid with the Moon in medieval times.
It was described by monks at Canterbury Cathedral in England as a red glow on and around the Moon.
How long after the asteroid hit the Moon, which is \($distance\) away,
would the light first arrive on Earth?
$PAR
\( t = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of average velocity to solve for the change in time?
At what velocity does light propagate through empty space?
END_HINT
