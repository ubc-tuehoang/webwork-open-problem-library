$PAR
Suppose a man stands in front of a mirror as shown above.
His eyes are \($distance_eyes\) above the floor,
and the top of his head is \($distance_head\) higher.
Find the height above the floor of the top and bottom of the smallest mirror
in which he can see both the top of his head and his feet.
How is this distance related to the man's height?

$PAR
The bottom of the mirror is \{ans_rule(10)\} above the floor.

$PAR
The top of the mirror is \{ans_rule(10)\} above the floor.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of reflection.

\( \displaystyle h_{bottom} = \frac{h_{eyes}}{2}
