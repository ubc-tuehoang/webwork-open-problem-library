BEGIN_TEXT

a) What is the focal length of a magnifying glass that produces
a magnification of \($magnification\) when held \($object_distance\) from an object,
such as a rare coin?
$PAR
\( f = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for the focal length?
How can you substitute out the unknown image distance, recalling one of the formul&#230; for magnification?
END_HINT
BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) Calculate the power of the magnifier in diopters.
$PAR
\( P = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} \(\textrm{D}\)

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for focal power.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

The image distance is
\( d_i = - d_o m = - $object_distance \times $magnification = $image_distance \)
$PAR
The focal length is given by
$PAR
\( \displaystyle f = \frac{d_i d_o}{d_o + d_i}
  = \frac{($image_distance)($object_distance)}{$object_distance + $image_distance}
  = $focal_length
\)
$PAR
b)
The power of the magnifier is
$PAR
\( \displaystyle P = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{$focal_length} = $focal_power \ \rm D\)
