BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose a \($focal_length\) focal length telephoto lens
is being used to photograph mountains \($object_distance\) away.
$PAR
a) Where is the image?
$PAR
\( d_i = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for the image distance?
END_HINT
BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) What is the height of the image of a \($object_height\) high cliff on one of the mountains?
$PAR
\( h = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}

END_TEXT


BEGIN_HINT
Using your answer from part (a) above, can you first determine the factor by which the lens magnifies the the image?
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR $BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD $PAR

\( \displaystyle d_i = \frac{f d_o}{d_o - f}
  = \frac{($focal_length)($object_distance)}{$object_distance - $focal_length}
  = $image_distance
\)
$PAR
b)
The magnification is given by
\( \displaystyle m = \frac{d_i}{d_o}
  = \frac{- $image_distance}{$object_distance}
  = $magnification
\)
$PAR
Therefore, the height of the image is
$PAR
\( h_i = m h_o = $magnification \times $object_height
  = $image_height
\)
