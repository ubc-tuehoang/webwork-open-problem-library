*WARNING: Because this problem is multiple choice, you are permitted ONLY ONE ATTEMPT.  Use it wisely.*

What does combining [$A] and [$B] subtractively yield?

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'Red',  'Green',  'Blue',
  'Cyan',  'Magenta',  'Yellow',
  'Black',  'White',
) ], $ans )}

Explain how the lattice in Figure 8.6 can tell you the answer.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Combining colors subtractively can be done using the lattice in Figure 8.6 as follows:  Find the two colors you wish to combine.  Their combination is the highest node that sits below both of the colors you're combining.  (By "sits below," we mean connected by the diagonal paths in the diagram.)

In the case of [$A] and [$B], the only colors below both are [$ans] and Black.  The highest of those is [$ans].
