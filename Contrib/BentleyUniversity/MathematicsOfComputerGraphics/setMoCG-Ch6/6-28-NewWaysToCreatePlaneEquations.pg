TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
The POV code for a plane, in its simplest form, is as follows.

[| plane { <a,b,c>, d } |]

The POV documentation (Section 3.4.5.3.1) states that this code creates the plane that satisfies the equation [`ax+by+cz-d\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=0`].

This tells us how to translate POV plane code into an equation of a plane in standard form.

Now assume we wish to convert in the other direction. Given the equation of a plane in standard form, [`Ax + By + Cz + D = 0`], you wish to render the plane in POV.  What POV code would you write?

[|plane <|][_____]{"A"},[_____]{"B"},[_____]{"C"}[|>,|] [____________________]{"-D/sqrt(A*A+B*B+C*C)"} [|}|]
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We want [`ax+by+cz-d\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=0`] to match [`Ax+By+Cz+D=0`].  So set [`a=A,b=B,c=C`], and then we must choose [`d`] so that [`-d\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=D`].

This is not difficult to solve for [`d`], and while weâ€™re at it we replace [`a`], [`b`], and [`c`] with their values from the standard form plane equation, giving

[`d=-\frac{D}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}=-\frac{D}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.`]

Thus the POV code would look like this.

[|plane { <A,B,C>, -D/sqrt(A*A+B*B+C*C) }|]
