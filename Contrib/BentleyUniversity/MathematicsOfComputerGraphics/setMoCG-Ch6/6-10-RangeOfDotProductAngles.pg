TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Your textbook gives the following equation for finding the angle between vectors [`\vec v`] and [`\vec w`]:

>> [`\theta=\cos^{-1}\left(\hat v\cdot\hat w\right)=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vec v\cdot\vec w}{\left\|\vec v\right\|~\left\|\vec w\right\|}\right) `] <<

What is the smallest value of [`\theta`] that such a formula might yield?

Answer: [_____]{0} radians, which is [_____]{0} degrees

What is the largest value of [`\theta`] that such a formula might yield?

Answer: [_____]{3.14159265358} radians, which is [_____]{180} degrees

On a related note, the dot product of two unit vectors has what maximum and minimum values?

Minimum: [_____]{-1} and maximum: [_____]{1}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The [`\cos^{-1}`] function always outputs values between 0 and [`\pi`] in radians, or 0 and 180 in degrees.  Inputs to that function are always between [`-1`] and [`1`].
