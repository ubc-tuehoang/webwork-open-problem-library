BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We compare the first control point of each curve to see if they match.  If so, then we are able to form a translational surface from the two curves.

For the first question, the two starting control points are [`([$C11x],[$C11y],[$C11z])`] and [`([$C21x],[$C21y],[$C21z])`], which are [$z.(($which==1)?'equal':'not equal')], so we [$z.(($which==1)?'can':'cannot')] form a translational surface.

For the second question, the two starting control points are [`([$C31x],[$C31y],[$C31z])`] and [`([$C41x],[$C41y],[$C41z])`], which are [$z.(($which==2)?'equal':'not equal')], so we [$z.(($which==2)?'can':'cannot')] form a translational surface.
