BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For shape 1:

- There are 4 vertices on the leftmost face of the structure, then another 4 to the right of those, and so on, [$n1+1] times, for a total of [`V=[$n1+4+4]`].
- There are 4 edges forming a ring around the leftmost face of the structure, then another ring of 4 to the right of those, and so on, [$n1+1] rings across the whole structure, for a total of [$n1*4+4] edges in rings.  Then each of the [$n1] cubes has 4 edges that are parallel to the length of the structure, which gives us another [$n1*4] edges.  The total is thus [`E=[$n1*4+4]+[$n1*4]=[$n1*8+4]`].
- There is a face on the left and a face on the right, which makes two faces.  Then each of the [$n1] cubes also has 4 faces forming a ring around it, which makes [$n1*4].  Thus the total is [`V=[$n1*4+2]`].
- [`\chi=V-E+F=2`]

If it had [`n`] cubes, the answers would be these:

- [`V=4n+4`] (each ring of vertices contains 4, and there are [`n+1`] rings)
- [`E=8n+4`] (each ring of edges contains 4, and there are [`n+1`] rings, plus 4 edges per cube parallel to the length of the structre, for another [`4n`])
- [`F=4n+2`] (2 for the ends, plus 4 for each of the [`n`] cubes)
- [`\chi=V-E+F=2`]

For shape 2:

- There are [$n2+1] rows of vertices, each of which contains [$m2+1] vertices, so [`V=[$n2+1]\times[$m2+1]=[$n2*$m2+$n2+$m2+1]`].
- There are [$n2+1] rows of edges, each of which contains [$m2] edges, making [$n2*$m2+$m2] horizontal edges.  There are [$m2+1] columns of edges, each of which contains [$n2] edges, making [$m2*$n2+$n2] vertical edges.  The total is thus [`E=[$n2*$m2*2+$n2+$m2]`].
- There are [$n2] rows of faces, each of which contains [$m2] faces, for a total of [`F=[$n2*$m2]`].
- [`\chi=V-E+F=1`]

If it had [`n`] squares vertically and [`m`] horizontally, the answers would be these:

- [`V=(n+1)(m+1)`] (because if the squares form an [`n\times m`] grid, then the vertices form an [`(n+1)\times(m+1)`] grid)
- [`E=n(m+1)+m(n+1)`] (because there are [`n`] vertical edges per column in [`m+1`] columns, and the opposite for rows)
- [`F=nm`] (because it's [`n`] squares high and [`m`] wide)
- [`\chi=V-E+F=1`]

For shape 3:

- There are [$n3*2+1] columns of vertices, each of which contains 4 vertices, making [`V=[$n3*8+4]`].
- There are [$n3*2+1] columns of edges, each of which contains 3 edges, making [$n3*6+3] vertical edges.  There are 4 rows of edges, each of which contains [$n3*2+1] edges, making [$n3*8+4] horizontal edges.  Thus [`E=[$n3*6+3]+[$n3*2+1]=[$n3*8+4]`].
- There top and bottom rows each have [$n3*2+1] faces, and the middle row has [$n3+1].  Thus [`F=[$n3*5+3]`].
- [`\chi=V-E+F=[$n3*-1+1]`]

If it had [`n`] holes, the answers would be these:

- [`V=8n+8`] (two columns of 4 vertices around each hole is [`8n`] plus the two columns of 4 vertices on each end of the structure)
- [`E=14+10`] (there are [`2n+1`] columns of squares, each having 4 horizontal edges, which gives [`8n+4`]; there are [`2n+2`] columns of 3 vertical edges, which gives [`6n+6`]; add those expressions)
- [`F=5n+3`] (each hole has a C-shape of 5 faces surrounding it left, above, below, plus 3 in the rightmost column)
- [`\chi=V-E+F=1-n`]
