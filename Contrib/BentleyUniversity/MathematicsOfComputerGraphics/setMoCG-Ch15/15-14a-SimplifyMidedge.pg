BEGIN_PGML
Examine the equations on page 411 of the text for the sizes of a mesh produced by the midedge subdivision algorithm.  Now assume that the mesh has no boundary (for example, it might be a sphere or a cube).  How would the formulas simplify?  Use [`V,E,F`] for the number of vertices/edges/faces in the original mesh.

[`V'=`][__________]{"E"}

[`E'=`][__________]{"2E"}

[`F'=`][__________]{"F+V"}

If the original mesh had [`V=[$V],E=[$E],F=[$F]`], what would those values be for the new mesh?

[`V'=`][__________]{$E}

[`E'=`][__________]{2*$E}

[`F'=`][__________]{$F+$V}

What if the algorithm were applied again to that new mesh, producing yet a third mesh, for which we write [`V'',E'',F''`]; what would those values be?

[`V''=`][__________]{2*$E}

[`E''=`][__________]{4*$E}

[`F''=`][__________]{$F+$V+$E}

What if the algorithm were applied [`n`] times to the original mesh, and we write [`V^n,E^n,F^n`] for the counts of vertices/edges/faces in the resulting mesh.  What would those values be (in terms of [`n`])?

[`V^n=`][__________]{"$E*2^(n-1)"}

[`E^n=`][__________]{"$E*2^n"}

[`F^n=`][__________]{"$F+$V+(2^(n-1)-1)*$E"}

In a mesh with no boundary, if [`V=[$V2],E=[$E2],F=[$F2],V^n=[$E2*2**($n-1)],E^n=[$E2*2**$n],F^n=[$F2+$V2+(2**($n-1)-1)*$E2]`], how many iterations of the midedge subdivision algorithm were applied?

[`n=`][__________]{$n}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
On page 411, the text says [`V'=E+V_b`], but there is no boundary, so [`V_b=0`].  Thus we can write [`V'=E`].

The text also says [`E'=2E_i+3E_b`], but we know [`E_b=0`], so we can write [`E'=2E_i`], except the problem told us to use [`E`] for the number of edges in the original mesh, so we write [`E'=2E`].

The text also says [`F'=F+V`], which needs no change, beacuse it had nothing to do with the boundary.

If we apply those formulas when [`V=[$V],E=[$E],F=[$F]`], we end up with [`V'=[$E],E'=[$E*2],F'=[$F+$V]`].

If we apply them again to those results, we get [`V''=[$E*2],E''=[$E*4],F''=[$F+$V+$E]`].

You can apply them several more times to find a pattern, and the result is as follows.

- [`V^n=[$E](2^{n-1})`]
- [`E^n=[$E](2^n)`]
- [`F^n=[$V+$F]+[$E](2^{n-1}-1)`]

We could iterate the equations a few times in the final part to find that [`n=[$n]`].
