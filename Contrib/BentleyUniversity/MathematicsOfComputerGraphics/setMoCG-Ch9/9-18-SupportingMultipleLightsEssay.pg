BEGIN_PGML
If the procedures and formulas in this chapter were extended to support multiple light sources in a scene, what would need to change?

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Rather than compute the contributions of diffuse and specular from just one light source, the two contributions would need to be computed for all light sources, and all the contributions (together with the one ambient contribution for the whole scene) summed to find the pixel color (still capping the sum at a maximum of 1 in each component).
