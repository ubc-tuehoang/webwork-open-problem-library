BEGIN_PGML
What center should a sphere of radius [$a] have so that it sits on the xy plane with its bottom (lowest point in the z direction) just touching the origin?

Answer: ([_____]{0},[_____]{0},[_____]{$a})

What center should a sphere of radius [$b] have so that it sits on top of the previous sphere (that is, higher in the z direction, touching the previous sphere at just one point)?

Answer: ([_____]{0},[_____]{0},[_____]{2*$a+$b})

What are the two opposite corners of a box that tightly contains the previous two spheres (and whose edges are parallel to the axes)?

First give the corner with all positive coordinates:
([_____]{$m},[_____]{$m},[_____]{2*($a+$b)})

Then give the corner opposite that one:
([_____]{-$m},[_____]{-$m},[_____]{0})

What center should a sphere of radius [$c] have so that it sits on top of the point [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`]?

Answer: ([_____]{$x},[_____]{$y},[_____]{$z+$c})

What center should a sphere of radius [$d] have so that it hangs just below the previous sphere, touching it at just one point?

Answer: ([_____]{$x},[_____]{$y},[_____]{$z-$d})

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
A sphere centered at [`(0,0,[$a])`] will have its lowest point at the origin (and its highest point at [`(0,0,[$a*2])`]).

A sphere centered at [`(0,0,[$a*2]+[$b])`], which is [`(0,0,[$a*2+$b])`], will have its lowest point at [`(0,0,[$a*2])`], which therefore just touches the previous sphere.

The larger of the two radii is [$m], and thus in the x and y directions, the sphere reach out as far as [`\pm [$m]`].  We know that their lowest point in z is at [`z=0`] and their highest point will be the top of the second sphere, or [`z=[$a*2+b]+[$b]=[$a*2+$b*2]`].  Thus the corners of the box go as high as [`([$m],[$m],[$a*2+$b*2])`] and as low as [`(-[$m],-[$m],0)`].

A sphere centered at [`([$x],[$y],[$z+$c])`] will have its lowest point at [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`].

A sphere centerd at [`([$x],[$y],[$z-$d])`] will have its highest point at [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`].
