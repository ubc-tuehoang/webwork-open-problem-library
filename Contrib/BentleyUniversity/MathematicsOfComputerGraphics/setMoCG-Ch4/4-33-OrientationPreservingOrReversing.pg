BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
[`S_{1,1,1}=I=R_{0,0,0}`]

[`S_{1,1,-1}`] has an odd number of flips, and is thus orientation reversing.  Based on the definition of that term in the text, it cannot be equivalent to any rotation.

[`S_{1,-1,1}`] is the same as the previous.

[`S_{1,-1,-1}`] negates y and z, which is the same as doing [`R_{180^\circ,0,0}`].  You can tell this by computing [`R_{180^\circ,0,0}(x,y,z)`].

[`S_{-1,1,1}`] is the same as the other orientation-reversing ones.

[`S_{-1,1,-1}`] negates x and z, and is thus [`R_{0,180^\circ,0}`].

[`S_{-1,-1,1}`] negates x and y, and is thus [`R_{0,0,180^\circ}`].

[`S_{-1,-1,-1}`] is also an odd number of flips, and thus orientation reversing, and thus equivalent to none of the rotations.
