TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Determine what formula you would use to rotate a figure by an angle of [`[$angle]^\circ`] about the line parallel to the [$axisnames[$axisindex]] axis and passing through the point [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`].  That is, how would you create a rotation transformation that leaves the line through [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`] (and parallel to the [$axisnames[$axisindex]] axis) unmoved, and rotates the rest of space around it, by an angle of [`[$angle]^\circ`]?

You may assume that the rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from the positive end of the [$axisnames[$axisindex]] axis.

The answer is of the form [`T_{a,b,c}R_{d,e,f}T_{g,h,i}`].  What are the values of the variables?

Any real number is acceptable for [`a`], so we do not ask for that value.

[`b=`][_____]{$y}

[`c=`][_____]{$z}

[`d=`][_____]{$subscripts[0]}

[`e=`][_____]{$subscripts[1]}

[`f=`][_____]{$subscripts[2]}

Any real number is acceptable for [`g`], so we do not ask for that value.

[`h=`][_____]{-$y}

[`i=`][_____]{-$z}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Rationale for the above answers:

[`T_{-[$x],-[$y],-[$z]}`] moves [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`] to the origin.

[`R_{[$suscripts[0]],[$subscripts[1]],[$subscripts[2]]}`] rotates about the origin, which now contains the point about which we want to rotate.

[`T_{[$x],[$y],[$z]}`] moves [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`] back to its original location.
