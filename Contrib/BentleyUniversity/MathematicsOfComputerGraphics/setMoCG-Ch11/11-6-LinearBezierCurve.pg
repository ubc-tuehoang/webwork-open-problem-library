TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
A linear B[$e]*zier curve between two points [`A`] and [`B`] is the straight line function from Chapter 6 of the textbook.  (In Chapter 12 of the text, we will see all the types of B[$e]*zier curves, beyond cubic linear.)

What is the formula for that vector-valued function?

Answer: [_________________]{"(1-t)*A+t*B"}

What is the formula for its derivative?

Answer: [_________________]{"B-A"}

What is the initial velocity of an object following the linear path?

Answer: [_________________]{"B-A"}

What is the final velocity of an object following the linear path?

Answer: [_________________]{"B-A"}

What is the acceleration of that vector-valued function?

Answer: [_________________]{0}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
A linear path of motion from [`A`] to [`B`] has initial position [`A`] and velocity [`B-A`], and so it can be written as [`\vec f(t)=A+(B-A)t`], or [`(1-t)A+tB`].

Its derivative is therefore just [`B-A`], which means both the initial and final velocities are [`B-A`].  Its second derivative (acceleration) is therefore zero.
