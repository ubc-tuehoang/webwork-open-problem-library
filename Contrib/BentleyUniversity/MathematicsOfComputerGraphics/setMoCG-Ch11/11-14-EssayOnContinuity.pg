TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
In one of the exercises in the textbook, it discusses an animation of a race car swerving around an obstacle, over two scenes, each governed by its own B[$e]*zier curve (as in Figure 11.12).  It requires the reader to connect the scenes so that *the final velocity of the first scene matches the initial velocity of the second scene.*

In another exercise in the textbook, it discusses an animation of a tennis ball bouncing in a tennis court, over two scenes, one before the bounce and one after (as in Figure 11.11).  In that example *the initial velocity of the second scene is _not_ equal to the final velocity of the first scene.*

Explain what effect this difference has, and why it is appropriate.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If the velocity changes suddenly at the point where scene 1 touches scene 2, then the car will seem to jerk as if struck by some outside object or force. This is desirable when a collision or other sudden force occurs at that moment.

That did not happen with the car, so we wanted to keep the velocities the same.  It did happen with the tennis ball, which collided with the ground, so we wanted the velocities different.

More details are covered in Chapter 13.
