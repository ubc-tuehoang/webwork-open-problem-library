BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The expression [`([$a],[$b])`] refers to a point in two dimensional space, [$a] units to the right of the origin and [$b] units above it.

The expression [`\langle [$a],[$b] \rangle`] refers to a two-dimensional vector, which expresses a motion of [$a] steps to the right and [$b] steps upward.  It does not contain any notion of starting or ending location.

If [`\langle [$a],[$b] \rangle`] were placed so that it started at the origin, it would end at the point [`([$a],[$b])`].
