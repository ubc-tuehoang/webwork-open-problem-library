In Chapters 11 and 12 of the textbook, we will explore easing curves, which can be composed with a vector-valued function to make a new vector-valued function whose animation starts or stops more gently than that of the original. If an easing curve [`e : [0, 1]\to[0, 1]`] is a function of one variable and [`\vec f : \Bbb{R}\to\Bbb{R}^3`] is a vector-valued function, we can create a composite function [`\vec g = \vec f \circ e`], whose formula is [`\vec g(t) = \vec f(e(t))`].

Here I graph for you the following functions on the interval [`[0,1]`]:

- [`e_1(t) = 3t^2-2t^3`] (the red curve)
- [`e_2(t) = t^3`] (the green curve)
- [`e_3(t) = 3t-3t^2+t^3`] (the blue curve)

One of the curves [`e_1`], [`e_2`], or [`e_3`] is an ease-in curve, meaning that the motion begins slowly.  Another is an ease-out curve, meaning that the motion ends slowly. Another is an ease-in-out curve, meaning that the motion begins and ends slowly. Which is which?

  'That function is an ease-in-out curve.',

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Because [`e_1(t)=3t^2-2t^3`], we have [`e'_1(t)=6t-6t^2`].  Setting that equal to zero and solving gives [`6t(1-t)=0`], which has only two solutions, 0 and 1.

Because [`e_2(t)=t^3`], we have [`e'_2(t)=3t^2`].  Setting that equal to zero and solving gives only [`t=0`].

Because [`e_3(t)=3t-3t^2+t^3`], we have [`e'_3(t)=3-6t+3t^2`].  Setting that equal to zero and solving gives [`3(1-t)(1-t)=0`], which has only one solution, [`t=1`].

The red curve [`e_1`] has initial and final velocity 0, meaning that it starts from rest and ends at rest, for a gentle beginning and ending, making it the ease-in-out curve.

The green curve [`e_2`] has initial velocity 0, but final velocity higher (note its sharp upward slope at [`t=1`] on the graph).  Thus it is the ease-in curve.

The blue curve [`e_3`] has final velocity 0, but initial velocity higher (note its sharp upward slope at [`t=0`] on the graph).  Thus it is the ease-out curve.
