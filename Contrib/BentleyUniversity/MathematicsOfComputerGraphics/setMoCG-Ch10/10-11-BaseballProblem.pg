TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Consider a baseball game in which an outfielder picks up a ball from the ground and throws it toward home plate, along the path

>> [`\vec p(t)=([$f1],[$f2],[$f3]),`] <<

with distance measured in feet and time in seconds. This vector-valued function is mostly realistic, except that for simplicity it ignores air resistance.

What is the ball's speed, in feet per second, at the beginning of its arc?

Answer: [__________]{$ans1} feet/second

What is that value in miles per hour?

Answer: [__________]{$ans1mph} miles/hour
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Speed is the magnitude of velocity, so we must first begin by computing the velocity function.

[`\vec p'(t)=\left\langle [$f1->D('t')],[$f2->D('t')],[$f3->D('t')] \right\rangle`]

Then we find the velocity at the beginning of the throw ([`t=0`]).

[`\vec p'(0)=\left\langle [$v1],[$v2],[$v3] \right\rangle`]

The magnitude of that is speed, in feet per second.

[`\sqrt{([$v1])^2+([$v2])^2+([$v3])^2}\approx[$ans1]`]

To convert to miles per hour, we multiply rates as shown below.

[`[$ans1]\frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}
\cdot\frac{1\text{ mile}}{5280\text{ feet}}
\cdot\frac{3600\text{ seconds}}{1\text{ hour}}
=[$ans1mph]\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}`]
