TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
The previous problem in this set introduced the concept of a function [`h : [0, 1]\to[0, 1]`] that can be composed with a vector-valued function to create a new vector-valued function. In that exercise, the purpose was to smooth (or "ease") a vector-valued function's motion, but there are other uses to which such a function [`h`] could be put. You'll explore some in this problem. As always, assume the motion of [`\vec f`] we care about is when [`0 \leq t \leq 1`].

Create a function [`h_1`] such that [`\vec f \circ h_1`] follows the same path as [`\vec f`], but in reverse.

Answer: [`h_1(t)=`][_______________]{"1-t"}

Create a function [`h_2`], whose graph is shown below, such that [`\vec f \circ h_2`] follows the same path as [`\vec f`], then reverses direction and returns to [`\vec f(0)`].

Answer: [`h_2(t)`] is a piecewise-defined function.

When [`t \leq \frac12`], [`h_2(t)=`][_______________]{"2t"}.

When [`t > \frac12`], [`h_2(t)=`][_______________]{"2-2t"}.

Create a parabolic function [`h_3`], whose graph is shown below, such that [`\vec f \circ h_3`] behaves like [`\vec f \circ h_2`], but with a smoother transition at [`t = \frac12`].

[@ image(insertGraph($graph2), width=>400, height=>400) @]*

Answer: [`h_3(t)=`][_______________]{"-4t(t-1)"}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To swap [`t=0`] with [`t=1`] and transition smoothly between them, use [`h_1(t)=1-t`].  See the graph below to help your intuition for this answer.

[@ image(insertGraph($graph3), width=>400, height=>400) @]*

Each half of [`h_2`] is a straight line segment, so you can simply use the endpoints to find a slope and use ordinary techniques from algebra.

First half: [`(0,0)`] to [`\left(\frac12,1\right)`], slope 2, formula [`2t`].

Second half: [`\left(\frac12,1\right)`] to [`(1,0)`], slope -2, formula [`2-2t1`].

For the parabola, note that its x intercepts are 0 and 1.  So we could create the formula [`t(t-1)`] as a start, then notice that at [`t=\frac12`], its value is not 1 (as desired), but [`-\frac14`].  If we multiply it by -4 to correct this problem, we have [`h_3(t)=-4t(t-1)=4t-4t^2`].  This has the desired shape.
