BEGIN_PGML
*WARNING: Because this problem is/contains multiple choice, you are permitted A LIMITED NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS.  Use them wisely.*

Consider an object following the path of the following vector-valued function.

Function: [`\vec f(t)=\left([$f1],[$f2],[$f3]\right)`]

What is the distance *along a straight line* from its starting point to its ending point?

Answer: [__________]{$ans1}

Is that equal to the distance the object would travel from time [`t=0`] to time [`t=1`]?

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'Yes, the object would travel the same distance',
  'The object would travel a different distance, but it may be more or less',
  'The object would travel a lesser distance',
  'The object would travel a greater distance',
  'It is not possible to tell from the information given'
) ], 'The object would travel a greater distance' )}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Starting point: [`\vec f(0)=\left([$f1->eval(t=>0)],[$f2->eval(t=>0)],[$f3->eval(t=>0)]\right)`]

Ending point: [`\vec f(1)=\left([$f1->eval(t=>1)],[$f2->eval(t=>1)],[$f3->eval(t=>1)]\right)`]

Distance between those points: [`\sqrt{([$f1->eval(t=>1)]-[$f1->eval(t=>0)])^2+([$f2->eval(t=>1)]-[$f2->eval(t=>0)])^2+([$f3->eval(t=>1)]-[$f3->eval(t=>0)])^2}=\sqrt{([$f1d])^2+([$f2d])^2+([$f3d])^2}\approx[$ans1]`]

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, but [`\vec f`] is clearly nonlinear (because it has exponents on the parameter) and thus an object following that path will cover a greater distance than [$ans1] from [`t=0`] to [`t=1`].
