TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Consider a POV scene file in which the shapes Ball, Box, Cone, and Pyramid have been defined. Assume that POV is considering the line of sight through a pixel and has computed its intersection with each of the four objects as follows.

The line of sight intersects [|object { Ball }|] when [`[$t1a]\leq t \leq[$t1b]`].

The line of sight intersects [|object { Box }|] when [`[$t2a]\leq t \leq[$t2b]`].

The line of sight intersects [|object { Cone }|] when [`[$t3a]\leq t \leq[$t3b]`].

The line of sight intersects [|object { Pyramid }|] when [`[$t4a]\leq t \leq[$t4b]`].

Consider the following block of code.

[|union {|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][|intersection {|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][`\hspace{1em}`][|object { Ball }|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][`\hspace{1em}`][|object { Box }|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][|}|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][|difference {|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][`\hspace{1em}`][|object { Cone }|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][`\hspace{1em}`][|object { Pyramid }|]

[`\hspace{1em}`][|}|]

[|}|]

For what [`t`] values is the line of sight inside the object defined by the intersection block?

Answer: [_____]{$ans1a}[`\leq t \leq`][______]{$ans1b}

For what [`t`] values is the line of sight inside the object defined by the difference block?

Answer: [_____]{$ans2a}[`\leq t \leq`][______]{$ans2b}

For what [`t`] values is the line of sight inside the object defined by the union block?

Answer: [_____]{$ans3a}[`\leq t \leq`][______]{$ans3b}

The intersection of [`[$t1a]\leq t \leq[$t1b]`] and [`[$t2a]\leq t \leq[$t2b]`] is [`[$ans1a]\leq t \leq[$ans1b]`].

The difference of [`[$t3a]\leq t \leq[$t3b]`] and [`[$t4a]\leq t \leq[$t4b]`] is [`[$ans2a]\leq t \leq[$ans2b]`].

The union of [`[$ans1a]\leq t \leq[$ans1b]`] and [`[$ans2a]\leq t \leq[$ans2b]`] is [`[$ans3a]\leq t \leq[$ans3b]`].
