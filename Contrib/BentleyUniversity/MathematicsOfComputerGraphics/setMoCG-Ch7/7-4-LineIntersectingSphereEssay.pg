TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
If you solve for when a line of sight intersects a sphere and get two [`t`] values, [$t1] and [$t2], what is going on in the scene?

[@ ANS(essay_cmp); essay_box(5,50) @]*

Which [`t`] value, if either, represents the part of the sphere that should be seen through the pixel?

Answer: [`t=`][______]{$answer}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The camera is inside the sphere. The part of the sphere that should be seen is the positive [`t`] value, [$answer], which is the wall of the sphere thatâ€™s in front of the camera (seen from the inside).
END_PGML_SOLUTION
