BEGIN_PGML
The four Bernstein polynomials of degree 3 are shown in the following graph.  Red shows [`(1-t)^3`], green shows [`3t(1-t)^2`], blue shows [`3t^2(1-t)`], and black shows [`t^3`].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We can find where [`3t(1-t)^2`] surpasses [`(1-t)^3`] by setting them equal to one another.

>> [`3t(1-t)^2=(1-t)^3`] <<

>> [`4t^3-9t^2+6t-1=0`] <<

This is difficult to solve with algebra (though not impossible).  You could guess that the solution is at about [`t=\frac14`], and confirm this by substitution.  Or you could use a computer algebra system (such as WolframAlpha) to find all solutions, which would give [`t=\frac14`] and [`t=1`], from which we're obviously concerned with just the first one.

So the interval is [`\left[0,\frac14\right]`].  This is 25% of the entire interval [`[0,1]`].

We can find where [`3t^2(1-t)`] surpasses [`3t(1-t)^2`] by setting them equal.

>> [`3t^2(1-t)=3t(1-t)^2`] <<

>> [`6t^3-9t^2+3t=0`] <<

>> [`t(2t-1)(t-1)=0`] <<

Thus [`t=0`] or [`t=\frac12`] or [`t=1`].  The one of these we care about is obviously [`t=\frac12`].

Thus the interval is [`\left(\frac14,\frac12\right)`], which is 25% of the entire interval [`[0,1]`].

We can find where [`t^3`] surpasses [`3t^2(1-t)`] by setting them equal.

>> [`t^3=3t^2(1-t)`] <<

>> [`4t^3-3t^2=0`] <<

>> [`t^2(4t-3)=0`] <<

Thus [`t=0`] or [`t=\frac34`].  The one of these we care about is obviously [`t=\frac34`].

Thus the interval is [`\left(\frac12,\frac34\right)`], which is 25% of the entire interval [`[0,1]`].

And furthermore the final interval is therefore [`\left(\frac34,1\right]`], another 25% of the whole.
