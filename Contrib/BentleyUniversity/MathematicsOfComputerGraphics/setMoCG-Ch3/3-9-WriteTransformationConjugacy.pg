TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Determine what formula you would use to scale a figure by a factor of [$scaleFactor] about the point [`([$x],[$y])`].  That is, how would you create a scaling transformation that leaves the point [`([$x],[$y])`] unmoved, and scales the rest of the plane around it, to [$scaleFactor] times its original size?

The answer is of the form [`T_{a,b}S_{c,d}T_{e,f}`].  What are the values of the variables?

[`a=`][_____]{$x}

[`b=`][_____]{$y}

[`c=`][_____]{$scaleFactor}

[`d=`][_____]{$scaleFactor}

[`e=`][_____]{-$x}

[`f=`][_____]{-$y}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Rationale for the above answers:

[`T_{-[$x],-[$y]}`] moves [`([$x],[$y])`] to the origin.

[`S_{[$scaleFactor],[$scaleFactor]}`] scales about the origin, which now contains the center about which we want to scale.

[`T_{[$x],[$y]}`] moves [`([$x],[$y])`] back to its original location.
