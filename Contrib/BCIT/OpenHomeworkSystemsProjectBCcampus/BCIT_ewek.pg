BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you have a \($cratemass kg\) wooden crate resting on a
wood floor The coefficient of static friction is: \($coestat\), and the coefficient of kinetic friction is: \( $coekin\). 
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD}  What maximum force can you exert
horizontally on the crate without moving it? 
$BR
Maximum force: \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD}  If you
continue to exert this force once the crate starts to slip,
what will the magnitude of its acceleration then be?
$BR
Acceleration: \{ ans_rule(10) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we use the formula: \(F_f = F_N \cdot \mu\), we know once the force with which we push surpasses the force of friction calculated with this formula the box will move. Thus: \(F_f = $cratemass \cdot 9.81 \cdot $coestat = $fricforcestat N\). We use the static coefficient of friction because the box is not moving.
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we take the force calculated in part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} and subtract it from the force of friction on the same box when it moves. This is calculated with the same formula but with the kinetic coefficient of friction instead of the static one. The force of friction on a moving box is \(F_f = $cratemass \cdot 9.81 \cdot $coekin = $fricforcekin N\). Then we subtract this from the answer to part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD}: \($fricforcestat - $fricforcekin\). This is the net force on the box and we divide by mass to find acceleration: \(\frac{$netforce}{$cratemass} = $acc m/s^2\).
