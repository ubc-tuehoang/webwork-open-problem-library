BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we know that the current is constant between both resistors. To find this current, we first find the equivalent resistance of both resistors in series: \[R_{\mbox{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 = $resistor1 + $resistor2 = $Sresistance \hspace{0.1cm} \Omega\] Then with the equation \(V = IR\) we can find the current through each resistor: \(I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{$voltage}{$Sresistance} = $Scurrent \hspace{0.1cm} A\). As stated above this current is the same for both resistors. The power on each resistor can be found with the equation: \(P = I^2R\), thus \(P_1 = $Scurrent^2 \cdot $resistor1 = $SpowerR1 \hspace{0.1cm} J/s\), and \(P_2 = $Scurrent^2 \cdot $resistor2 = $SpowerR2 \hspace{0.1cm} J/s\).

For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we know that the voltage is constant across both resistors. To find the current in each resistor we use the formula for voltage: \(V = IR\), thus \(I_1 = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{$voltage}{$resistor1} = $Pcurrent1 \hspace{0.1cm} A\), and \(I_2 = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{$voltage}{$resistor2} = $Pcurrent2 \hspace{0.1cm} A\). To find the power we use these currents and the equation \(P = I^2R\), thus \(P_1 = $Pcurrent1 \cdot $resistor1 = $Ppower1 \hspace{0.1cm} J/s\), and \(P_2 = $Pcurrent2 \cdot $resistor2 = $Ppower2 \hspace{0.1cm} J/s\).
