A truck with \($radius \hspace{0.1cm} m\) radius tires travels at \($truckVelocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\).
What is the angular velocity of the rotating tires in
radians per second? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(rad/s\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

First we find the circumference of the tire: \(c = 2 \pi r = 2 \cdot \pi $radius = $circ \hspace{0.1cm} m\). Next we know that \($truckVelocity\) of the wheel is rotated every second, thus we divide this distance by the circumference to find how many revolutions per second the wheel is doing: revolutions per second \(= \frac{v}{c} = \frac{$truckVelocity}{$circ} = $rev \hspace{0.1cm} rev/s\), which multiplied by \(2 \pi \) is converted into angular velocity: \($rev \cdot 2 \pi = $angVel \hspace{0.1cm} rad/s\).
