${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} involves solving for the charge in the formula for voltage: \(V = k\frac{q}{r}\). Rearrange to get: \(q = V \frac{r}{k} = $voltage \cdot \frac{$diameter \div 2}{$k} = $charge \hspace{0.1cm} C\).
$BR
$BR
Part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} involves first finding the kinetic energy possessed by the particle flying at \($velocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\): \(E_K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $massShow \times 10^{-6} \cdot $velocity^2 = $energy \hspace{0.1cm} J\). This kinetic energy was converted from the original electric potential energy that this particle had. We know that the particle had \($energy \hspace{0.1cm} J\) of electric potential energy in the paint sprayer. Since electric potential of a charge is the voltage times charge we find the charge of the small particle by dividing the electric potential energy by the voltage: \(q = \frac{E_p}{V} = \frac{$energy}{$voltage} = $chargeParticle \hspace{0.1cm} C\).
