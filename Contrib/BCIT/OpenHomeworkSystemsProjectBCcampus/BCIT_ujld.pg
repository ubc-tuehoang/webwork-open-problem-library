A commuter backs her car out of her garage with an
acceleration of \($acceleration m/s^2\). 
$BR

${BBOLD}a)${EBOLD}
How long does it take her to
reach a speed of \($velocity m/s\)? 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(s\)
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}b)${EBOLD} 
If she then brakes to a stop in
\($breaktime s\), what is her deceleration?
\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m/s\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

a) The time it takes to accelerate to the specified speed is velocity divided by acceleration by the formula \(v = u + at\): \(\frac{$velocity}{$acceleration} = $timeR s\)
$BR
$BR
b) By the same formula the deceleration is the velocity divided by the breaking time: \(\frac{$velocity}{$breaktime} = $decelerationR m/s^2\)
