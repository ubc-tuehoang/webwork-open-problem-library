BEGIN_TEXT

When tightening a bolt, you push perpendicularly on a
wrench with a force of \($force \hspace{0.1cm} N\) at a distance of \($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\) from
the center of the bolt. How much torque are you
exerting in newton meters (relative to the center of the
bolt)? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(Nm\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

To find the torque we multiple the distance between the pivot and the point of applied force by the force being applied: \(\tau = rF = $distance \cdot $force = $torque \hspace{0.1cm} Nm\)
