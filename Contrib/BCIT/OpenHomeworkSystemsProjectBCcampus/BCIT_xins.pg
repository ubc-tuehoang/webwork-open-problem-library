A \($mass \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) billiard ball that is moving at \($vi \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) strikes
the bumper of a pool table and bounces straight back at
\($vf \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\). The collision lasts
0.0150 \(s\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we first find the difference in initial momentum and final momentum before and after the collision (also known as impulse), then divide this impulse by the time to find the average force as shown in the formula: \(\Delta p = F \Delta t\):
$BR
$BR
\(p_i = mv = $mass \cdot $vi = $pi kg \cdot m/s\)
$BR
\(p_f = mv = $mass \cdot $vf = $pf kg \cdot m/s\)
$BR
\(\Delta p = p_i - p_f = $pi - $pf = $impulse kg \cdot m/s\)
$BR
\(F_{\mbox{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{$impulse}{$time} = $avgForce \hspace{0.1cm} N\)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we find the initial and final kinetic energy using the formula: \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\), and then find the difference between the two:
$BR
$BR
\(E_{k_i} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $mass \cdot $vi^2 = $EKi \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
\(E_{k_f} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $mass \cdot $vf^2 = $EKf \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
\(\Delta E_k = E_{k_i} - E_{k_f} = $EKi - $EKf = $EKdiff \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(c)${EBOLD} we divide the final kinetic energy by the initial kinetic energy and multiply by \(100\):
$BR
$BR
Percent = \(\frac{E_{k_f}}{E_{k_i}} = \frac{$EKf}{$EKi} = $perc \hspace{0.1cm} %\)
