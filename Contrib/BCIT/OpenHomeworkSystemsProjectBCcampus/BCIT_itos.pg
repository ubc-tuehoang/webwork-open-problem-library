BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that a corpse was discovered in a room and its temperature was
\($a^{\circ}C\). The temperature of the room was kept constant at
\($b^{\circ}C\). Three hours later the temperature of the corpse
dropped to \($c^{\circ}C\). Assuming the temperature of a corpse at
time of death is \(37^{\circ}C\), find the time of death.
$PAR
The time of death was approximately  \{ ans_rule(7) \} minutes (round to a whole number) before the corpse was discovered.
