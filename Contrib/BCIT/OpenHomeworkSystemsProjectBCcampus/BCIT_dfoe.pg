If two equal charges of \($charge \hspace{0.1cm} C\) each are separated in air
by a distance of \($distanceShow \hspace{0.1cm} km\), what is the magnitude of the force
acting between them? You will see that even at a distance
as large as \($distanceShow \hspace{0.1cm} km\), the repulsive force is substantial
because \($charge \hspace{0.1cm} C\) is a significant amount of charge. Enter your answer in scientific notation. See \{ helpLink("syntax") \} for help.

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Solving for the force using the formula \(F_e = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\) will give us the force: \(F_e = 8.99 \times 10^{9} \cdot \frac{$charge^2}{$distance^2} = $force \hspace{0.1cm} N\)
