The propeller of a World War II fighter plane is \($diameter \hspace{0.2cm} m\) in
diameter.
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} What is its angular velocity in radians per second if it
spins at \($revvelocity \hspace{0.2cm} rev/min\)? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(rad/s\)

velocity if the plane is stationary on the tarmac? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m/s\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we convert revolutions per minute to radians per second. Keep in mind 1 revolution is \(2\pi\) radians and there are 60 seconds in a minute. We have:
$BR
Radians per second: \(\frac{$revvelocity}{60} \cdot 2\pi = $angvelocity \hspace{0.2cm} rad/s\)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we multiply the angular velocity found in part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} by radius (how much distance is being covered per radian in a second).
$BR
Linear speed: \($angvelocity \cdot \frac{$diameter}{2} = $linspeed \hspace{0.2cm} m/s\)
$BR
$BR
The centripetal acceleration in part ${BBOLD}(c)${EBOLD} is given by the equation: \(a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}\).
$BR
Centripetal acceleration: \(\frac{$linspeed^2}{\frac{$diameter}{2}} = $centacc \hspace{0.2cm} m/s^2\)
