Hot gases produced by the combustion of gun powder accelerate a bullet
down the barrel of a gun. What is the average force exerted on a
\($mass \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) bullet to accelerate it to a speed of
\($velocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) in a time of \($time \hspace{0.1cm}
ms\) (milliseconds)? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(N\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The average force is calculated by finding the impulse on the bullet and then using the formula \(\Delta p = F \Delta t\) to find the average force over the time given:
$BR
$BR
\(\Delta p = m_{f}v_{f} - m_{i}v_{i} = ($mass \cdot $velocity) - 0 = $impulse \hspace{.1cm} kg \cdot m/s\)
$BR
$BR
\(F_{\mbox{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{$impulse}{$time} = $avgForce \hspace{.1cm}N\)
