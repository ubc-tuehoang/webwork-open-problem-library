Using energy considerations, calculate the average force
a \( $mass \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) sprinter exerts backward on the track to
accelerate from \( $v1 \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) to \( $v2 \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) in a distance of \($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\),
if he encounters a headwind that exerts an average force
of \( $headforce \hspace{0.1cm} N\) against him.

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

To find the average force we must first find the total energy expended over the distance. To do this first we calculate the change in kinetic energy: \(\delta E_K = \frac{1}{2}m(v_f-v_i) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $mass \cdot ($v2 - $v1) = $Edelta \hspace{0.1cm} J\), then we must calculate the total energy expended overcoming the headwind: \(W = F \cdot s = $headforce \cdot $distance = $work \hspace{0.1cm} J\). Finally we add these two and then divide by the distance to find the average force as shown in the formula for work: \(F = \frac{W}{s} = \frac{$Edelta + $work}{$distance} = \frac{$netWork}{$distance} = $avgForce \hspace{0.1cm} N\)
