${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The tension in part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} is equal to the gravitational force on the spider as the spider is motionless and therefore the tension must be equal and opposite such that there is no net force. The gravitational force is \(F_g = g \cdot m = -9.81 \cdot $spidermass \cdot 10^{-5} = $tensionA N\); this is equal and opposite to the tension we are looking for.
$BR
$BR
The tension in part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} is found by first finding the vertical contribution of each end of the string's tension and then performing trig to calculate the total tension on each end. First we know that each end contributes half of the tension needed to counter the gravitational force, so each vertical component of tension is \(\frac{9.81 \cdot $spidermass \cdot 10^{-5}}{2} = $tensionyB{}N\). We know that the total tension times the sine of the sag angle is the vertical component so we divide the vertical component of the tension by sine to find the total tension: \(\frac{$tensionyB}{\sin($sagangle)} = $tensionB N\)
$BR
$BR
Part ${BBOLD}(c)${EBOLD} involves dividing the answer from ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} by the answer from part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} and deducing the ratio: \(\frac{$tensionB}{$tensionA} = $rationum\). Thus we conclude the ratio is $ratio[$ratioindex].
