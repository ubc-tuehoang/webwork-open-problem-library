BEGIN_TEXT

In one of the classic nuclear physics experiments at the
beginning of the 20th century, an alpha particle was
accelerated toward a gold nucleus, and its path was
substantially deflected by the Coulomb interaction. If
the energy of the doubly charged alpha nucleus (2 protons) was 5.00
MeV, how close to the gold nucleus (79 protons) could it
come before being deflected? (proton charge: \(1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}\))

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The point of deflection is when all of the kinetic energy of the alpha particle has turned into potential energy and thus is about to change direction. To find this point we must rearrange the formula for electric potential energy, \(E_p = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r}\), into \(r = k \frac{q_1q_2}{E_p}\) and solve for r by plugging in the alpha particle's kinetic energy for \(E_p\): 
$BR
$BR
\(r = k \frac{$alphaChargeShow \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \cdot $nucleusChargeShow \cdot 1.6 \times 10^-19}{$alphaEnergy} = $distanceShow \times 10^{-14} \hspace{0.1cm} m\)
