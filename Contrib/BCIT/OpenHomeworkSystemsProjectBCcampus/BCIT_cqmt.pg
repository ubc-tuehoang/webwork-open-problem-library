Two children push on opposite sides of a door during
play. Both push horizontally and perpendicular to the
door. One child pushes with a force of \($forceC1 \hspace{0.1cm} N\) at a distance
of \($distanceC1 \hspace{0.1cm} m\) from the hinges, and the second child pushes
at a distance of \($distanceC2 \hspace{0.1cm} m\). What force must the second
child exert to keep the door from moving? 
$BR
$BR
First determine with what torque the first child acts on the door: 
$BR
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(Nm\)
$BR
$BR
Next determine with what force the second child must push to match this torque:
$BR
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(N\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

We know that the torque of the two children must be the same for the door not to move. To find the first child's torque we use the formula for torque: \(\tau = rF = $distanceC1 \cdot $forceC1 = $torqueC1 \hspace{0.1cm} Nm\). Since this torque must be equivalent to the torque applied by the second child, we can rearrange the formula for torque and solve for force using the torque just calculated: \(F = \tau \div r = $torqueC1 \div $distanceC2 = $forceC2 \hspace{0.1cm} N\).
