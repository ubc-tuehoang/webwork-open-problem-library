Suppose a child drives a bumper car head on into the
side rail, which exerts a force of \($force \hspace{0.1cm} N\) on the car for
\($time \hspace{0.1cm} s\). 
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} What impulse is imparted by this force? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(kg \cdot m/s\)
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} Find the final velocity of the bumper car if its initial
velocity was \($vi \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) and the car plus driver have a mass
of \($mass \hspace{0.1cm} kg\). You may neglect friction between the car and
floor. \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m/s\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we use the formula, \(\Delta p = F \Delta t\), to calculate the impulse: \(\Delta p = $force \cdot $time = $impulse\). 
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we first calculate the initial momentum of the system, then subtract the impulse (or change in momentum), before then using the formula, \(p = mv\), to calculate the final velocity: 
$BR
$BR
\(p = mv = $mass \cdot $vi = $pi\)
$BR
\(p_{f}=p_i - \Delta p = $pi - $impulse = $pf\)
$BR
\(v_f = \frac{p_f}{m} = \frac{$pf}{$mass} = $vf\)
