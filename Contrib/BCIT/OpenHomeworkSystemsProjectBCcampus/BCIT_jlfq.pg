A doubly charged ion is accelerated to an energy of \($energyShow \hspace{0.1cm} keV\) by the electric field between two parallel conducting
plates separated by \($distanceShow \hspace{0.1cm} cm\). What is the electric field
strength between the plates? 
$BR
$BR
First find the accelerating electric potential: \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(kV\)
$BR
$BR
Next find the electric field: \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(N/C\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The energy is given in electron volts (the energy given by accelerating an electron through a potential of \(1 V\)) so we know that the electric potential through which the electron was accelerated is \($voltageShow \hspace{0.1cm} kV\). We then use this voltage and the formula: \(E = \frac{V}{d}\) to calculate the electric field between the plates: \(E = \frac{$voltage}{$distance} = $field \hspace{0.1cm} N/C\).
