What is the magnitude and direction of the force
exerted on a \($chargeShow \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) charge by a \($field \hspace{0.1cm} N/C\) electric field
that points due east? 

Direction: 
$BR
$BR
\{ $radio1->buttons() \}
$BR
$BR
Force:
$BR
$BR
\{ $radio2->buttons() \}

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

To find the direction we must look at the charge sign. The force on positive charges is in the direction of the field, while forces on negative charges go the opposite direction. Since the field points east and the charge is \($chargeShow \hspace{0.1cm} \mu c\), we know the force points $direction. To find the force we multiply the field which is Newtons per unit charge by the charge being put in the field: \(|F| = |Eq| = |$field \cdot ($chargeShow) \times 10^{-6}| = $force \hspace{0.1cm} N\).
