A tree falls in a forest. How many years must pass before the
\(^{14}C\) activity in \($mass \hspace{0.1cm} g\) of the tree's carbon
drops to \($activityFinal\) decay per hour? For the half-life of
\(^{14}C\) use \(5730\cdot{}365\cdot{}24\) hours. \{ ans_rule(10) \} thousand years (round your answer to the nearest integer)

The formula for activity is \(A = \lambda N_0 e^{- \lambda t}\), we can rearrange this into a formula for the time:

\[t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{A}{\lambda N_0}\right)}{- \lambda}\]

To solve this equation we must first find the original number of carbon atoms which is the number of moles (mass divided by molar mass) multiplied by Avogadro's number:

\[N_0 = \frac{$mass}{14} \cdot 6.0221409 \times 10^{23} = $nop \times 10^{23} \hspace{0.1cm} \mbox{atoms}\]

Then we must find the decay constant using the following formula:

\[\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\mbox{half-life of }^{14}C} = \frac{\ln(2)}{$halflife} = $decayConstantShow \times 10^{-8}\]

Finally we plug these values into the formula for time:

\[t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{$activityFinal}{$decayConstantShow \times 10^{-8} \cdot $N_0Show \times 10^{23}}\right)}{-$decayConstantShow \times 10^{-8}} = $time \hspace{0.1cm} \mbox{hours}\]

Convert to years:

\[$time \div 24 \div 365 = $timeyears \hspace{0.1cm} \mbox{years}\]
