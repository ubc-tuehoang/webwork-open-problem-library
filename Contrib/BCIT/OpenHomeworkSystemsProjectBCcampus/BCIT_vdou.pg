A battery-operated car utilizes a \($voltage \hspace{0.1cm} V\) system. Find the
charge the batteries must be able to move in order to
accelerate the \($mass \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) car from rest to \($velocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\), make it
climb a \($height \hspace{0.1cm} m\) high hill, and then cause it to
travel at a constant \($velocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\) by exerting a \($force \hspace{0.1cm} N\)
force for an hour. \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(C\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

There are three stages of energy use in this question we must calculate this energy for each:
$BR
$BR
Stage 1: Acceleration
$BR
We find the final kinetic energy: \(E_K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $mass \cdot $velocity^2 = $energyAcc \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
$BR
Stage 2: Climbing the hill:
$BR
We find the increase in gravitational potential energy: \(E_p = mgh = $mass \cdot 9.81 \cdot $height = $energyHil \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
$BR
Stage 3: Maintaining speed:
$BR
We find the total work done by the force: \(W = F \cdot s = $force \cdot $distance = $energyFor \hspace{0.1cm} J\)
$BR
$BR
Finally we add all of these values together and divide by the voltage as we know that the potential energy of the charges (which was converted into the energy we just calculated) is equal to the electric potential multiplied by the charge: \(Q = \frac{E}{V} = \frac{$energyAcc + $energyHil + $energyFor}{$voltage} = $charge \hspace{0.1cm} C\)
