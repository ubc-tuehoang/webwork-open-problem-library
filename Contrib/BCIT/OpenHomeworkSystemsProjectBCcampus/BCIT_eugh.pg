What is the effective resistance of a car's starter motor
when \($current \hspace{0.1cm} A\) flows through it as the car battery applies
\($voltage \hspace{0.1cm} V\) to the motor?

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

This question requires an application of Ohm's law, which states that voltage is equal to the resistance times the current. This means that resistance is equal to the voltage divided by the current: \(R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{$voltage}{$current} = $resistance \hspace{0.1cm} \Omega\).
