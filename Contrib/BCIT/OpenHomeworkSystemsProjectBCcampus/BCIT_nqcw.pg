BEGIN_TEXT

How far apart must two point charges of \($chargeShow \hspace{0.1cm} nC\) (typical
of static electricity) be to have a force of \($force \hspace{0.1cm} N\) between
them? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

To find the distance we rearrange the formula \(F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\) for the force between charges into \(r = \sqrt{k\frac{q_1q_2}{F}}\) and solve for the distance \(r\): \(r = \sqrt{k\frac{q_1q_2}{F}} = \)\(\sqrt{$k \cdot \frac{$chargeShow \times 10^{-9} \cdot $chargeShow \times 10^{-9}}{$force}}\)\( = $distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\)
