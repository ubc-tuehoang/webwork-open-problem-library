Calculate the moment of inertia of a skater given the
following information. 
$BR
$BR
(a) The \($massA \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) skater is
approximated as a cylinder that has a \($radiusBody \hspace{0.1cm} m\) radius. \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(kgm^2\)
$BR
$BR
(b)
The skater with arms extended is approximately a
cylinder that is \($massB \hspace{0.1cm} kg\), has a \($radiusBody \hspace{0.1cm} m\) radius, and has
two \($armLength \hspace{0.1cm} m\) long arms which are \($massArm \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) each and
extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated
about their ends. \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(kgm^2\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we use the formula for the moment of inertia for a rigid cylinder rotating around its length: \(I = \frac{mr^2}{2} = \frac{$massA \cdot $radiusBody^2}{2} = $inertiaA \hspace{0.1cm} kgm^2\).
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we use the formula used above to find the moment of inertia of the body and add this to the moment of inertia of both arms. 
$BR
$BR
\(I = \frac{m_{body}r_{body}^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (\frac{m_{arm}L_{arm}^2}{3} + m_{arm}d^2)\)
$BR
$BR
We add \(m_{arm}d^2\) by the Parallel-Axis Theorem to account for the extra distance between the arm cylinders and the axis of rotation. In this situation d, which is the distance between the object's center of mass and the rotation axis, is the radius of the body cylinder and half of the arm cylinder's length.
$BR
$BR
\(I = \frac{$massB \cdot $radiusBody^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (\frac{$massArm \cdot $armLength^2}{3} + $massArm \cdot ($radiusBody + $armLength \div 2)^2) = $inertiaB \hspace{0.1cm} kgm^2\)
