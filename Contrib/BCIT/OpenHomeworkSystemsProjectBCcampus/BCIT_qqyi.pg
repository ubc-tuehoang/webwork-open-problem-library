The formula for work we use in this situation is \(W = F \cdot s \cdot \cos(\theta)\). Ignore \(\cos(\theta)\) as the direction of the force is the same as the displacement. We use this formula to calculate both the work of the elevator: \(W = ($gravity + $friction) \cdot $displacement = $workelevator \hspace{0.1cm} J\), and the work of gravity: \(W = -$gravity \cdot $displacement = $workgravity \hspace{0.1cm} J\).
