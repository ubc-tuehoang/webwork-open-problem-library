${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} Calculate the number of photoelectrons per second
ejected from a \($areamm \hspace{0.1cm} mm\)
area of sodium metal by
\($wavelengthnm \hspace{0.1cm} nm\) EM radiation having an intensity of \($intensity \hspace{0.1cm} W/m^2\)
(the intensity of sunlight above the Earth's
atmosphere). Enter your answer in scientific notation. See \{ helpLink("syntax") \} for help. \{ ans_rule(10) \} photoelectrons per second
$BR

${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} Given that the binding energy is \($bindingEnergy \hspace{0.1cm} eV\), what energy is carried away by the electrons? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(eV\)

Use \(h = 4.14 \times 10^{-15} \hspace{0.1cm} eV/Hz, c = 299792458 \hspace{0.1cm} m/s, C=6.242\times{}10^{18}\mbox{ atomic units}\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we know how many Joules are being applied
per second by the radiation. We also know how much energy is being
carried per photon via the wavelength. Thus we convert the intensity
to \(eV/s/m\): \(\hspace{0.2cm} $intensity \cdot 6.242 \times 10^{18}
= $intensityevShow \times 10^{21} \hspace{0.1cm} eV/s/m\) and then
divide it by the energy of the photons which is: \(E_p =
\frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{hc}{$wavelengthnm \times 10^{-9}}=
$photonEnergy \hspace{0.1cm} eV\).
$BR
$BR
Photon intensity = \($intensityevShow \times 10^{-21} \div $photonEnergy = $photonIntensityShow \times 10^{-21}\) photons per second (this is the same as the number of photoelectrons ejected)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we subtract the binding energy from the photon energy calculated above: \($photonEnergy - $bindingEnergy = $electronEnergy \hspace{0.1cm} eV\)
