What is the strength of the electric field between two
parallel conducting plates separated by \($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\) and
having a potential difference (voltage) between them of \($voltageShow \times 10^4 \hspace{0.1cm} V\)
? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(N/C\)

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The electric potential between two parallel plates is desribed by the formula: \(V = Ed\). If we rearrange this formula we can solve for \(E\): \(E = \frac{V}{d} = \frac{$voltage}{$distance} = $E\).
