Point charges of \($charge1Show \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) and \(- $charge2Show \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) are placed
\($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\) apart with the first on the left and the second on the right. Where can a third charge be placed so
that the net force on it is zero?
$BR
$BR
Since the electric field (\(E = k \frac{q}{r^2}\)) at the point where we place the third charge must be \(0\), first rearrange the equivalency \(k \frac{q_1}{r_1^2} = -k \frac{q_2}{r_2^2}\) into an equation for the ratios of the distance from the point in question to the first charge and to the second charge:
$BR
$BR
\{ $mc1->print_a() \}
$BR
$BR
Next, to reduce the number of variables in this equation, find the equation for the distance from the point in question to the first charge in terms of the distance to the second charge:
$BR
$BR
\{ $mc2->print_a() \}
$BR
$BR
Next plug this formula into the equation for the ratio between distances and solve for \(r_2\) and determine its direction in relation to the second charge:
$BR
$BR
distance: \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m\)
$BR
direction: \{ $popup->menu() \}
$BR
$BR
Finally, use this distance to find \(r_1\) and determine its direction in relation to the first charge: 
$BR
$BR
distance: \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m\)
$BR
direction: \{ $popup->menu() \}

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Rearranging the equivalency \(k \frac{q_1}{r_1^2} = -k \frac{q_2}{r_2^2}\) can be done by the following steps:
$BR
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} k \frac{q_1}{r_1^2} = -k \frac{q_2}{r_2^2}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} \frac{q_1}{r_1^2} = - \frac{q_2}{r_2^2}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} q_1 \cdot r_2^2 = -q_2 \cdot r_1^2\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} - \frac{q_1}{q_2} = \frac{r_1^2}{r_2^2}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} - \frac{q_1}{q_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}^2\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} \sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\)
$BR
$BR
Because the second charge is negative and the first is positive we know that the point where their electric fields cancel to \(0\) is to either the right of both charges or the left of both. Thus we know that the distance from the third charge to the first is \(r_1 = r_2 + $distance\).
$BR
$BR
Next we must plug in known values into the equation for the ratio between \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) and solve for \(r_2\):
$BR
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} \sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} \sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} = \frac{r_2 + $distance}{r_2}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 \cdot \sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} = r_2 + $distance\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 \cdot \sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} - r_2 = $distance\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 \cdot (\sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} - 1) = $distance\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 = \frac{$distance}{\sqrt{- \frac{q_1}{q_2}} - 1}\)
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 = \frac{$distance}{\sqrt{- \frac{$charge1Show \times 10^{-6}}{(-$charge2Show) \times 10^{-6}}} - 1}\)
$BR
$BR
\(\hspace{0.4cm} \therefore \hspace{0.1cm} r_2 = $dist2\)
$BR
Because this is negative, the direction is to the left. Enter the absolute value of the distance in the answer box above.
$BR
$BR
Finally, we can use \(r_1 = r_2 + $distance\) to find \(r_1\):
$BR
$BR
\(r_1 = r_2 + $distance = $dist1\)
$BR
Because this is $sign, the direction is to the $direction. Enter the absolute value of the distance in the answer box above.
