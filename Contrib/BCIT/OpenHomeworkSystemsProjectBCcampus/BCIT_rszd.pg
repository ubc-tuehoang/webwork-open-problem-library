A test charge of \(+$c2S \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) is placed halfway between a
charge of \(+$c1S \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) and another of \(+$c3S \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) separated by \($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\).

charge? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(N\)
$BR

${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} What is the direction of this force? \{ $mc->menu() \} the \(+$c3S \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\) charge.

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The formula for the force between charges is \(k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\) so we apply this for each charge affecting the middle one and add their forces to find the net force:
$BR
$BR
Charge 1: \(F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{$c1S \times 10^{-6} \cdot $c2S \times 10^{-6}}{(\frac{$distance}{2})^2} = $f1\) \(N\)
$BR
Charge 2: \(F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{$c3S \times 10^{-6} \cdot $c2S \times 10^{-6}}{(\frac{$distance}{2})^2} = $f2\) \(N\)
$BR
$BR
Net Force (keep in mind the opposite directions thus the subtraction): \(F_{net} = F_1 - F_2 = $f1 - $f2 = $fnet\) \(N\)
$BR
$BR
The direction is determined by the larger charge. Since the distance between the middle charge and each side charge is the same and all charges in this situation are positive the net force will always point away from the larger charge as its effect on the middle charge is strongest as shown in the formula for force between charges given above. In this case the net force points $direction the \($c3S \hspace{0.1cm} \mu C\).
