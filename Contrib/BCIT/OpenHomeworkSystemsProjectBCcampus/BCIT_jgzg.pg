Electrons in an X-ray tube are accelerated through \($voltage \hspace{0.1cm} V\) and directed toward a target to produce X-rays. Calculate the power of the electron beam in this tube if it has a current of \($currentShow \hspace{0.1cm} mA\).

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Power is energy per unit time. We know how much energy this X-ray machine is supplying per charge through the voltage and we also know what the charge per unit time output is through the current. If we multiply the electric potential per unit charge (voltage) the machine supplies by how many charges are accelerated per second (current), we receive the total power in the electron beam of the X-ray machine: \(P = IV = $current \cdot $voltage = $power \hspace{0.1cm} J/s\)
