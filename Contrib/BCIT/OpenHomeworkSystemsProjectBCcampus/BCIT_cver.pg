BEGIN_TEXT

In his book "Outliers", author Malcolm Gladwell argues that more
baseball players have birthdates in the months immediately following
July 31, because that was the cutoff date for nonschool baseball
leagues. Here is a sample of frequency counts of months of birthdates
of American-born major league baseball players starting with January:
$b[0], $b[1], $b[2], $b[3], $b[4], $b[5], $b[6], $b[7], $b[8], $b[9], $b[10], $b[11]. Using a $alpha significance level, is there sufficient
evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that American-born major
league baseball players are born in different months with the same
frequency? Do the sample values appear to support Gladwell's claim?

$PAR

The test statistic is \(\chi^2=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

The critical value is \(\chi^2=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
