BEGIN_TEXT

A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a \($height \hspace{0.1cm} m\)
building and lands \($distance \hspace{0.1cm} m\) from the base of the
building. Ignore air resistance and use \(g=9.81\). 
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} How long is the ball
in the air? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(s\)
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} What must have been the initial horizontal
component of the velocity? \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m/s\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we rearrange the formula for displacement and solve for time: 
$BR
$BR
\(s = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\)
$BR
\(\therefore t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}}\)
$BR
\(\therefore t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot $height}{9.81}}\)
$BR
\(\therefore t = $time \hspace{0.1cm} s\)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we know the distance covered and the time in which it was covered so we can determine the velocity as it is the distance over time: \(v = \frac{s}{t} = \frac{$distance}{$time} = $velocity \hspace{0.1cm} m/s\);
