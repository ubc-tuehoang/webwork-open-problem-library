$deceleration = random(2.00, 2.10, 2.20, 2.30);
$time = random(1.70, 1.85, 2.00, 2.15);

$velocity = $deceleration * 10**4 * $time * 10**(-3);

A well-thrown ball is caught in a well-padded mitt. If the deceleration of the ball is \($deceleration \times 10^{4} m/s^2\), and \($time ms\) (\(1 ms = 10^{-3} s\)) elapses from the time the ball first touches the mitt until it stops, what was the initial velocity of the ball?
\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m/s\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

As deceleration is the change in velocity over one second, and we know the time over which this deleceration happened. Find the velocity by multiplication of the deceleration and the time: \($deceleration \times 10^{4} \cdot $time \times 10^{-3} = $velocity m/s\)
