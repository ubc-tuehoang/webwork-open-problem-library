A brave but inadequate rugby player is being pushed
backward by an opposing player who is exerting a force
of \($exertforce N\) on him. The mass of the losing player plus
equipment is \($playerLmass kg\), and he is accelerating at \($acceleration m/s^2\)
backward. 

$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} What is the force of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} What force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his mass plus equipment is \($playerWmass kg\)? \{ ans_rule(10) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} involves finding the difference between the exerted force and the apparent force pushing backwards revealed by the losing player's acceleration. We known that the exerted force minus the force of friction equals this apparent force or net force. This means that the exerted force minus the net force is equal to the force of friction. 
$BR
First we find the net force: \(F = ma = $playerLmass \cdot $acceleration = $netforce N\)
Then we find the force of friction: \(F_f = $exertforce - $netforce = $fricforce N\)
$BR
$BR
Part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} involves adding the force needed to accelerate the winning players body to the exerted force: \($playerWmass \cdot $acceleration + $exertforce = $forceonground N\)
