${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} the charge is give by the formula \(Q = It = $current \cdot $time = $charge \hspace{0.1cm} C\). For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} the number of electrons is given by the charge calculated in part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} divided by the charge of one electron: \($charge \div (1.6022 \times 10^{-19}) = $electronsShow \times 10^{19}\)
