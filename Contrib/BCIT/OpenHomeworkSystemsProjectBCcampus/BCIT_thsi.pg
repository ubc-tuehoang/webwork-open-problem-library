A power transmission line is hung from metal towers
with glass insulators having a resistance of \($resistanceShow \times 10^9 \hspace{0.1cm} \Omega\). What current flows through the
insulator if the voltage is \($voltageShow \hspace{0.1cm} kV\)? Enter your answer in scientific notation. See \{ helpLink("syntax") \} for help.

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

This question requires an application of Ohm's law, which states that voltage is equal to the resistance times the current. This means that current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance: \(I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{$voltage}{$resistance} = $currentShow \times 10^{-5} \hspace{0.1cm} A\).
