BEGIN_TEXT
A horizontal plane is ruled with parallel lines 2 inches apart. If a 2-inch needle is tossed randomly onto the plane, the probability that the needle will touch a line is

\[ P=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin\theta\,d\theta \]

where \(\theta\) is the acute angle between the needle and any one of the parallel lines. Find this probability.
$PAR
This is called Buffon's needle experiment. It can be used to approximate the number \(\pi\) experimentally.

\{ image( $buffon, height => 300, width => 221, tex_size=>300 )  \}

The solution is
\[P=\frac{2}{\pi}\left[-\cos\vartheta\right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}=\frac{2}{\pi}(0+1)=\frac{2}{\pi}\]
