## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects

### Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.
Context("Numeric");
# warn("Student name: $studentName, login: $studentLogin, id: $studentID");
my $hash = crypt($studentLogin, 'a1');
# warn("crypt: $hash");
@nums = (0..9,'a'..'z','A'..'Z');
my %nums = map { $nums[$_] => $_ } 0..$#nums;
my $seed = 0;
$seed = $seed * 39 + $nums{$_} foreach split(//, substr($hash, -5, 5));
# warn("seed: " . $seed);

### Call R server
rserve_eval("set.seed($seed)"); 
## The critical value is \($chicrit[0]\). Chistar is \($chistar\).

## i1<-sample(x=seq(1,5),size=1,replace=F);
## sl<-sls[i1];

cc<-qchisq($siglevel[$i1],df=9);

BEGIN_TEXT
Listed below are the heights in inches for the simple random sample of
supermodels Lima, Bundchen, Ambrosio, Ebanks, Iman, Rubik, Kurkova,
Kerr, Kroes, and Swanepoel. Consider the claim that supermodels have
heights that have less variation than heights of women in the general
population. Assume a normal distribution for the population. Use a $siglevel[$i1] significance level to test the claim
that supermodels have heights with a standard deviation that is less
than $claim inches for the population of women.
