${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Power is the amount of joules being supplied to a system per second so for part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we must find the amount of joules needed to speed up the car and for part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we must add this to the amount of extra joules needed to lift the car and then divide by the power being supplied to find the time:
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} \(E_K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot $mass \cdot $speed^2 = $carenergy \hspace{0.1cm} J\), then \(t = \frac{E_K}{P} = \frac{$carenergy}{$power} = $timeA  \hspace{0.1cm}s\) 
$BR
$BR
${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} \(E_g = mgh = $mass \cdot 9.81 \cdot $hill = $hillenergy \hspace{0.1cm}J\), then \(t = \frac{E_K+E_g}{P} = \frac{$carenergy + $hillenergy}{$power} = $timeB \hspace{0.1cm}s\)
