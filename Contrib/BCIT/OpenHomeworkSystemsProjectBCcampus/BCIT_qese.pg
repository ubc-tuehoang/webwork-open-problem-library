Suppose a \($birdmass \hspace{0.1cm} g\) kookaburra (a large kingfisher bird)
picks up a  \($snakemass \hspace{0.1cm} g\) snake and raises it  \($height \hspace{0.1cm} m\) from the
ground to a branch.

${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The formula for the work done by an active force is \(W = F \cdot s \cdot \cos(\theta)\). Ignore the cosine of theta because the direction of force and direction of movement are the same. Thus the work to bring the snake to the branch is the mass of the bird in \(kg\) multiplied by \(g\) and then multiplied by the height of the branch: \(W = $snakemass/1000 \cdot 9.81 \cdot $height = $snakework \hspace{0.1cm} J\). The same is true for the energy to bring the bird's own mass up: \(W = $birdmass/1000 \cdot 9.81 \cdot $height = $birdwork \hspace{0.1cm} J\).
