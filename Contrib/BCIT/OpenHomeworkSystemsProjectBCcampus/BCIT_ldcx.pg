If the straight-line distance from her home to the university is \($beeline km\) in a direction \($angle^\circ\) south of east, what was her average velocity (in \(km/h\))?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}
a) Average speed is the scalar distance travelled divided by the total time of trip: \(\frac{$distance}{\frac{$time}{60}} = $avgSpeed km/h\)
$BR
$BR
b) Average velocity is the vector distance (straight line distance) divided by the total time of the trip: \(\frac{$beeline}{\frac{$time}{60}} = $avgVelocity km/h\) 
$BR
$BR
c)
$BR 
Average speed for the round trip is the total scalar distance (twice the distance there) divided by the total time of the trip: \(\frac{2 * $distance}{\frac{$minutes}{60} + $hour} = $totalAvgSpeedR km/h\) 
$BR
Average velocity is always \(0\) for a round trip as the vector distance between a point and that same point is \(0 m/s\).
