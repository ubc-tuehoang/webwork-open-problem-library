## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects

### Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.

my $hash = crypt($studentLogin, 'a1');

my %nums = map { $nums[$_] => $_ } 0..$#nums;
my $seed = 0;
$seed = $seed * 62 + $nums{$_} foreach split(//, substr($hash, -5, 5));
# warn("seed: " . $seed);

### Call R server

BEGIN_TEXT
The following data shows volumes in ounces of a simple random sample
of 36 cans of regular Coke. Those volumes have a mean of $mm
ounces and a standard deviation of $ss ounces, and they appear
to be from a normally distributed population. The manufacturer of the
filling machine claims that the standard deviation is $claim ounces. Use
the sample data to test the claim that the manufacturer is correct and
that the population of volumes has a standard deviation equal to $claim
ounces. Use a $t1 confidence level.
