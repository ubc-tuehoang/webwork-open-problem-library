Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war.
Each of the first team's members has an average mass of
\($t1avgmass kg\) and exerts an average force of \($t1avgforce N\) horizontally.
Each of the second team's members has an average mass
of \($t2avgmass kg\) and exerts an average force of \($t2avgforce N\)
horizontally.

${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} What is magnitude of the acceleration
of the two teams? \{ ans_rule(10) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

For part ${BBOLD}(a)${EBOLD} we divide the total mass of every player by the net force of both teams pulling on each other: 
$BR
$BR
\(M_t = $t1avgmass \cdot 9 + $t2avgmass \cdot 9 = $totalmass kg\)
$BR
\(F_{\mbox{net}} = $t1avgforce \cdot 9 + $t2avgforce \cdot 9 = $netforce N\)
$BR
\(\left| \frac{$netforce}{$totalmass} \right| = $magacc\frac{m}{s^{2}}\)
$BR
$BR
For part ${BBOLD}(b)${EBOLD} we must choose a side and set up the net force equation for that side. Remember that the tension points in the opposite direction from the force of action. Choosing the left side we have the equation: \(F_{\mbox{net}} = F_{\mbox{team}} + F_T\). Thus: \(F_{\mbox{net}} - F_{\mbox{team}} = F_T\).
$BR
$BR
\(  $t1avgmass \cdot 9 \cdot $acc - $t1avgforce \cdot 9 = $tension1 N\)
