Two children of mass \($massC1 \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) and \($massC2 \hspace{0.1cm} kg\) sit balanced on
a seesaw with the pivot point located at the centre of the
seesaw. If the children are separated by a distance of \($seperation \hspace{0.1cm} m\), at what distance from the pivot point is the small child
sitting in order to maintain the balance? Assume the lighter child sits to the right of the pivot and the heavier child to the left and that the pivot is the origin, thus the lighter childs displacement is positive and vice versa for the heavier child.

\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{lighter child mass} & \ldots & m_{1} \\
\mbox{heavier child mass} & \ldots & m_{2} \\
\mbox{separation} & \ldots & d \\
\mbox{distance to pivot of lighter child} & \ldots & s_{1} \\
\mbox{distance to pivot of heavier child} & \ldots & s_{2} \\
\end{array}
\]
$BR
$BR
Using these variables set up the proper equation using each childs torques to solve for the first child's distance from the pivot: 
$BR
$BR
\{ $mc1->print_a() \}
$BR
$BR
Next reduce the number of variables by accurately representing the distance of the heavier child to the pivot in terms of the lighter child's distance to the pivot:
$BR
$BR
\{ $mc2->print_a() \}
$BR
$BR
Finally plug this into the first equation and solve for the distance of the lighter child to the pivot:
$BR
$BR
\(s_1 =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} \(m\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

We know that the torques of both children must add to \(0\): 
$BR
\(\therefore \tau_1 + \tau_2 = 0\)
$BR
\(\therefore \tau_2 = - \tau_1\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_2 \cdot m_2g = - s_1 \cdot m_1g\)
$BR
$BR
We also know that since the separation between the children is \($seperation \hspace{0.1cm} m\) that the distance of the heavier child to the pivot is the distance of the lighter child to the pivot minus or plus \($seperation \hspace{0.1cm} m\). Whether you subtract or add here is arbitrary as long as the sign of each child's distance to the pivot is different (they are on opposite sides of the pivot). Since we define the lighter child's displacement as positive, we say that the heavier child's displacement is \(s_2 = s_1 - $seperation\). 
$BR
$BR
With these equations worked out we can solve for \(s_1\):
$BR
$BR
\((s_1 - d) \cdot m_2g = - s_1 \cdot m_1g\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1m_2g - dm_2g   = - s_1 \cdot m_1g\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1m_2 + s_1m_1  = dm_2\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1(m_2 + m_1)  = dm_2\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1  = \frac{dm_2}{(m_2 + m_1)}\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1  = \frac{$seperation \cdot $massC2}{$massC2 + $massC1}\)
$BR
\(\therefore s_1  = $distanceC1 \hspace{0.1cm} m\)
