BEGIN_TEXT
This is Question 5 in the exam. 
$BR
The full question is provided on the course website. 
$BR
Answer one of True or False for parts (a)--(f). 
You don't have to give a reason
but for a result to be mathematically True, a proof is needed;
for a result to be False, a single counterexample is needed.
So think back to the many examples covered over the term.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (a) $EBOLD
$BR
If two regression models with continuous response are
compared, \(C_p\) and adjusted \(R^2\) always lead to the same conclusion
as to which of the two models is better.
\{ $mcf->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (b) $EBOLD
$BR
If two regression models with continuous response are
compared, \(R^2\) and adjusted \(R^2\) always lead to the same conclusion
as to which of the two models is better.
\{ $mcf->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (c) $EBOLD
$BR
If two regression models with continuous response are
compared, leave-one-out cross-validated mean squared error and 
adjusted \(R^2\) always lead to the same conclusion
as to which model is better.
\{ $mcf->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (d) $EBOLD
$BR
If two regression models with continuous response are
compared, residual SE and adjusted \(R^2\) always lead to the same conclusion
as to which of the two models is better.
\{ $mct->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (e) $EBOLD
$BR
If two logistic regression models with binary response
are compared, residual deviance and AIC (Akaike information criterion)
always lead to the same conclusion
as to which of the two models is better.
\{ $mcf->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (f) $EBOLD
$BR
Consider \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) as single explanatory variables for
\(y\). If \(|r_{x_1y}|>|r_{x_2y}|\), then \(x_1\) by itself is better
predictor variable for \(y\) than \(x_2\) by itself. 
\{ $mct->print_a() \}

$BR
(f)
True is correct.
False with explanation of possible nonlinear relation is better.
