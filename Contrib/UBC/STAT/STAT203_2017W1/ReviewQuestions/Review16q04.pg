BEGIN_TEXT
In the nineteenth century Darwin's theory of natural selection was not
widely accepted. A researcher in 1898 in Massachusetts presented data he had
gathered to explore natural selection. There had been an extreme storm the
winter of that year, and a sample of house sparrows had been brought to
Brown University to study. Some of these sparrows had survived the storm,
and some had perished. Of the adult males in the sample, 24 had perished
during the storm and 35 had survived. It was of interest to determine if
there were differences in the physical characteristics between the sparrows
that survived and those that died. The humerus bone was measured on each
bird (in inches). Suppose the sparrows collected that died had mean humerus
length @m1[0] inches with standard deviation @s1[0] inches.
Suppose the corresponding measurements for the sparrows that survived were 
@m2[0] inches and @s2[0] inches.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The estimate would be the difference in the sample
means, @m1[0]-@m2[0] = @ans1[0] inches ( or alternatively 
@m2[0] - @m1[0] = @ans1al[0] inches). 
$BR
$BR
(b) The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in the
mean humerus lengths between the sparrows that died and those that survived.
That is, \(H_{0}:\mu _{1}-\mu _{2}=0.\)
$BR
$BR
(c) We would take the alternative hypothesis as being \(H_{A}:\mu
_{1}-\mu _{2}\neq 0\).There is no reason to believe prior to the
study that the birds that survived would differ in bone lengths compared to
those that perished.
$BR
$BR
(d) For the pooled t-test, the test statistic is \(t=(\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{
x}_{2})/SE(\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2})\). To calculate the standard
error, SE, we find the pooled estimate of the unknown variance: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{p}^{2} &=&\frac{(24-1)\times @s1[0]^{2}+(35-1)\times @s2[0]^{2}
}{24+35-2} \\
&=& @var[0] \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ s_{p}= @sd[0].
\end{eqnarray*}
The standard error is 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
SE=s_{p}\sqrt{1/24+1/35}=@se[0].
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
So the t-statistic is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
t=\frac{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}{SE}=\frac{@m1[0]-@m2[0]}{SE}=$t1.
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
The test statistic can also be found via \(\left( @m2[0]-@m1[0]\right) /SE \).
$BR
$BR

(e) We should compare the test statistic with the t distribution on 57
degrees of freedom. As the test is two--sided, the P-value is @p[0].  
$BR
$BR
(f) If testing at the 5% significance level, if @p[0] >0.05 there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean humerus lengths between sparrows that survived the storm and those that died. Otherwise we would
reject the null hypothesis.
