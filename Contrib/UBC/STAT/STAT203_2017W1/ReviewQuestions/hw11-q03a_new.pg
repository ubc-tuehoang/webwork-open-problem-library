## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
In the cases of comparing BC residents by either mean income
or proportion below a low-income threshold with a known national mean,
these appear to describe one-sample inferences. The scenario involving
husbands and wives would be correctly investigated via a test involving
matched pairs, as incomes of spouses could not reasonably be considered
independent. The scenario comparing the proportions above and below two
income thresholds in BC involves only one population, and presumably would
require only one sample. The other two scenarios describe situations where
independent samples could be taken from two distinct populations, and
comparisons of the sample means would shed light on the difference in the
population means.
