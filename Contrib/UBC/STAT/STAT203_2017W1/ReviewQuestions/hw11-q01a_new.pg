One definition of obesity is in terms of body mass index (BMI). In a
study to compare obesity levels in two schools, random samples of fourth
graders were taken from each school and body mass indices recorded. Here is
a summary of the body mass index data from two schools, Laura Secord and
Charles Dickens.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameter of interest here is the difference in the
mean BMI of fourth graders at Laura Secord and Charles Dickens schools. 
$BR
$BR

(b) The estimate of this parameter from the data is @mu1[0]-@mu2[0]= @ansb[0]
(or -@ansb[0]). 
$BR
$BR

(c) The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean BMI
for fourth graders at the two schools. 
$BR
$BR

(d) The alternative hypothesis would be two-sided, as there is no
information to suggest one school would have higher mean BMI than the other
before the study.
$BR
$BR

(e) The correct test statistic standardises the difference in the
sample means, \(\bar{y}_{1}-\bar{y}_{2}\), by an estimate of the
standard deviation of that difference. 
$BR
$BR


(f) We use a two sample t test with pooled standard deviation, since 
@n1[0] and @n2[0] are small and the two sample standard deviations
are similar. The test statistic is \( t=(\bar{y}_{1}-\bar{y}_{2})/SE(\bar{y}
_{1}-\bar{y}_{2}) \). To calculate the SE, we first find the pooled
estimate of the common unknown population variances:

\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{p}^{2} &=& \frac{(@n1[0]-1)\times @s1[0]^{2}+(@n2[0]
-1)\times @s2[0]^{2}}{@n1[0]+@n2[0]-2} \\ 
&=& @var1[0].
\end{eqnarray*}

The standard error is
\[
SE=s_{p}\sqrt{1/@n1[0]+1/@n2[0]}= @sd2[0].
\]

So the t-statistic is
\[
t=\frac{\bar{y}_{1}-\bar{y}_{2}}{SE}=\frac{@mu1[0]-@mu2[0]}{SE}= @sd3[0].
\]

Using software or a t table, we find the 97.5% point of the \(t_{
@n1[0]+@n2[0]-2}\) distribution to be @sd4[0]. The two-sided test at 5% significance level rejects the null
hypothesis if \( |t|> @sd4[0]\). Otherwise there
is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the mean BMI of
fourth graders at the two schools are equal.
