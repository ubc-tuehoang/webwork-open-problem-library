BEGIN_TEXT
In biomechanics, the human body can be modelled as a combination of rigid bodies connected by joints (linkage or multi-link system). A kinematic chain (linkage of rigid bodies) can be open or closed. An open kinematic chain has one end of the chain, such as the distal end, free to move, while a closed kinematic chain has kinematic constraints on both ends of the chain. For instance, the kinematic chain of the arm is open during a bicep curl exercise, while is closed in a push up exercise.
