BEGIN_TEXT
A child throws a ball to her pet dog, as shown in the figure below. At the time of releasing the ball using an underhand throw, \(t_0\), the normal component of the acceleration of the hand is \(a_n = $an\) \(m/s^2\), the vertical distance between the ball and the ground is \(h_{b_0} = $hbo_cm\) cm, and the angle that the arm makes with the vertical is \(\theta = $theta\) degrees. The distance between the shoulder and the hand (or ball) is \(l_a = $la_cm\) cm. The dog catches the ball after a time interval of \(\Delta t\ = $dt\) s. $PAR
\{image("UBC-BME-KNM-20-006.png", width=>500, height=>262)\}
$PAR
a) Assuming the upper arm, forearm, and hand act as a single rigid body (swinging at a constant angular velocity), calculate the velocity of the hand (or the velocity of the ball) at \(t_0\).
$PAR
\(v\) = \{ ans_rule(8)\} \(\vec{i}\) + \{ ans_rule(8)\} \(\vec{j}\) \( m/s\)
$PAR
b) What is the horizontal distance travelled by the ball in the time interval \(\Delta t\)?
$PAR
\(d_H\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(cm\)
$PAR
c) At what height does the dog catch the ball (vertical distance between the ball and the ground after \(\Delta t\)? $PAR
\(h_{b_f}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(cm\)
