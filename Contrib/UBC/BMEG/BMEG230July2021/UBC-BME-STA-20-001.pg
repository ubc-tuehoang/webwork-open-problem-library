The femorotibial joint is a synovial hinge joint between the distal femur and  proximal tibia.
$PAR
For a $m \(kg\) person standing on one foot, determine the tension in the iliotibial band \(F_M\) and bone force \(F_R\) in this position if \(F_R\) acts $l_b_cm \(cm\) medially from the centre of rotation, which is circled in red below. The moment arm for weight and muscle forces are $l_w_cm \(cm\) (medial) and $l_m_cm \(cm\) (lateral) from the femorotibial joint's center of rotation, respectively.
