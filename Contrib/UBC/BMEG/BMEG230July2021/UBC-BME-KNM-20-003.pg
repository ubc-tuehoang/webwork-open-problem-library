Consider an individual doing hip abduction motions, shown in the image below. In the frontal plane, point O is the axis of rotation of the hip joint, line OB and OC are the the positions of the leg when it is stretched out at the highest and lowest elevations, respectively, and are the limits for the leg's range of motion. Line OA represents the neutral position, where the angle between OA and OB is equal to the angle between OA and OC - this angle is \(\theta_0\ = $theta0_deg^\circ\). 
$PAR
\{ image( "UBC-BME-KNM-20-003.png", width=>250, height=>270) \}
$PAR
Assuming that the person starts at the position shown in the figure (leg aligned with line OA), the individual's leg motion is symmetrical with respect to line OA, and the period of angular motion is \(\tau = $tao s\):
$PAR
$BITALIC Please answer all values to the third decimal place. $EITALIC
$PAR
A) Derive expressions for angular displacement \(\theta\), angular velocity \(\omega\), and angular acceleration \(\alpha\) of the leg. Express your answers of \(\theta\), \(\omega\), and \(\alpha\) in \(rad\), \(rad/s\), and \(rad/s^2\), respectively.
$PAR
\(\theta\) = \{ ans_rule(30)\} $BR
\(\omega\) = \{ ans_rule(30)\} $BR
\(\alpha\) = \{ ans_rule(30)\} $BR
$PAR
B) Determine \(\theta\), \(\omega\), and \(\alpha\) of the leg at $t1 s and $t2 s after the rotational motion began. Express your answers of \(\theta\), \(\omega\), and \(\alpha\) in \(rad\), \(rad/s\), and \(rad/s^2\), respectively.
$PAR
After $t1 second(s): $BR
\(\theta\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} 
\(\omega\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} 
\(\alpha\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
After $t2 second(s): $BR
\(\theta\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} 
\(\omega\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
