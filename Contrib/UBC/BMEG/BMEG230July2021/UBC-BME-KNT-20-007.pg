$d1 $d2 You are in a gait lab, studying the various forces and moments involved in walking. From a patient trial, you gather kinematic and kinetic data, and decide to analyze a specific point in time: 0.5s into the walk. 
$PAR
From the force plate, you gather  at this instant, the horizontal ground reaction force is $GRFx N, the vertical ground reaction force is $GRFy N, and the COP is ($COPx, 0) m. From marker data, you find that the coordinates of ankle, knee, and hip at this time point are ($anklex, $ankley) m, ($kneex, $kneey) m, and ($hipx, $hipy) m, respectively. $PAR
You also collect the following data: $BR
\{
DataTable(
  [
    [[' ', headerrow => 1], '\(m (kg)\)', '\(I (kg m^2)\)', '\(a_x (m/{s^2)}\)', '\(a_y (m/{s^2})\)', '\(\alpha (rad/{s^2})\)', '\(COM (m)\)'],
    [['Thigh', m=>1],'$mT', '$IT', '$axT', '$ayT', '$alphaT', '($COMxT, $COMyT)'],
    [['Leg', m=>1],'$mL', '$IL','$axL', '$ayL', '$alphaL', '($COMxL, $COMyL)'],

);
\}
$PAR
Calculate the reaction forces and moments at the subject's $BBOLD ankle $EBOLD at this point in time. Assume that the joint reaction forces and the moments are in the positive directions, and enter negative values below if your calculations result in opposite directions. $PAR 
\(F_x\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} N $BR
\(F_y\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} N  $BR
\(M_A\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} Nm
