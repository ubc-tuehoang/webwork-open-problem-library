Calculate a HIC15 for the resultant rider head acceleration (shown below) during a bucking motion. Is this likely to cause head injury, based on the HIC15 limit?

$PAR
Time window for maximum HIC: \(t =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(ms\) to \(t =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(ms\).

What is the HIC value for this time window? Only check the 15ms time window. $BR
HIC = \{ans_rule(10)\}
