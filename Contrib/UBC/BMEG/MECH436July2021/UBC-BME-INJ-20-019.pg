BEGIN_TEXT
A deceleration sled test is used to test the response of a new airbag. The vehicle buck weighs approximately $mBuck kg and the 95th percentile hybrid III ATD is seated inside the vehicle buck (driver's seat). The initial velocity is $v1_kmh km/hr and the mass of a 95th percentile Hybrid III ATD is $mHybrid kg:
