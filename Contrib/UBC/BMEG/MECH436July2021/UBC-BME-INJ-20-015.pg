You are exploring the injuries associated with improvised explosive device (IED) explosions under light armoured vehicles. The underbody armour is sufficient to prevent shrapnel from entering the occupant compartment, but the blast impact causes forces and accelerations on the seated occupants inside. $PAR

The following is a list of injuries sustained by an occupant who experienced an underbody IED blast in a light armoured vehicle. (Source: CIREN Case 397078650) $PAR
\{ image( "UBC-BME-INJ-20-015.png", width=>500, height=>300 ) \} $PAR

a) Find MAIS: $BR
\(MAIS\) = \{ans_rule(10)\}
