BEGIN_TEXT
You are exploring the injuries associated with improvised explosive device (IED) explosions under light armoured vehicles. The underbody armour is sufficient to prevent shrapnel from entering the occupant compartment, but the blast impact causes forces and accelerations on the seated occupants inside. $PAR

You find the following curve for head acceleration of a seated occupant during an underbody IED blast: $PAR
\{ image( "UBC-BME-INJ-20-014.png", width=>500, height=>350) \}
$PAR
Calculate HIC15 for this data (complete calculations for 15 ms, 9 ms, and 3 ms windows. $PAR
\(HIC15_{15 ms}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(HIC15_{9 ms}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(HIC15_{3 ms}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
$PAR
The \{ $popup->menu() \} window corresponds with the HIC15 for this data.
