BEGIN_TEXT
Assume the caught hand of the rider is in contact will the bull (i.e. \(d_{rope} = 0\)). From rider and video analysis, we find that the rider has a mass of $m kg and a height of $h m, \(\omega\) = $omega rad/s, and the width of the bull is $w m. From anthropometric data, we gather that the mass of a body without an arm is $ratio1*BW and the length from the hand to the rider's CG is $ratio2*H. $PAR
Solve for the force at the shoulder. $PAR
