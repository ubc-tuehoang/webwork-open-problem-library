BEGIN_TEXT
A $m kg plate fitted with a load cell (negligible mass) is accelerated into the thorax of a cadaveric specimen via pneumatic piston as part of an experiment:
$PAR
\{ image( "UBC-BME-INJ-20-007-1.png", width=>325, height=>200) \}
$PAR
If the impactor is accelerated at $a \(m/s^2\), what force does the load cell read prior to impact?
$PAR \(F_{cell}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} N
$PAR
The peak force during impact is found to be $Fp N (impactor acceleration = $aI \(m/s^2\)). 
$PAR
In what direction is the impactor accelerated during impact?
\{ $popup->menu() \}
$PAR 
What is the actual peak force on the thorax of the cadaveric specimen? 
$PAR \(F_{PMHS}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} N
