BEGIN_TEXT
Assume a rear-end collision takes place on a T-crossing road. The insurance company tried to find out whether the driver was speeding at the intersection. From Figure 2, Vehicle 1 (Blue Tesla Model 3) rear ended Vehicle 2 (red). Vehicle 2 was stationary and parked on the side of the road. The damage dimensions are given in an accident reconstruction form, shown below.
