BEGIN_TEXT
The point \((1,2)\) is in the x-y coordinate system. The p-q coordinate system uses the same origin and scale as the x-y system but the p-axis is rotated 30 degrees clockwise from the x-axis. (Similarly, the q-axis is rotated 30 degrees clockwise from the y-axis.) What are the coordinates of the point in the p-q system?
