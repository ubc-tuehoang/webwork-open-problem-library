BEGIN_TEXT
In a Cartesian system a point has the coordinates \((1,-2, 3)\). A cylindrical coordinate frame is defined such that the cylindrical z-axis points in the opposite direction to the Cartesian z-axis. In addition, the line defined by theta = 0 in the cylindrical frame points along the y-axis of the Cartesian frame. What are the coordinates of the point in the cylindrical frame? (use angles in radians).
