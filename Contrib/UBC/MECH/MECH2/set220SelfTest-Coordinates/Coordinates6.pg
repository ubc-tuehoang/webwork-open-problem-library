BEGIN_TEXT
The origin of the p-q system is located at \((10m, 2m)\) in the x-y system, with the p-axis oriented at \(\alpha = 15^{\circ}\) relative to the x-axis. The position of the ball in the p-q coordinate system is \((1, 3)\) where distance is measured in feet. What is the position of the ball in the x-y coordinate system (measured in metres)?
