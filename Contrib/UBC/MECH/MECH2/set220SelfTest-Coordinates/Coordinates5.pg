BEGIN_TEXT
The velocity of a ball in an x-y coordinate system is \((10, -5)\) where distance is measured in metres. A second coordinate system, p-q, uses units of feet (1 ft = 0.3048 m). The p-axis is oriented at \(\alpha = 15^{\circ}\) relative to the x-axis. The origin of the p-q system is located at \((10m, 2m)\) in the x-y system. What is the velocity vector of the ball in the p-q coordinate system?
