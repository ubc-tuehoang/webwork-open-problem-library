BEGIN_TEXT
A certain industrial process requires water flow rate of \(1500\) \(L/s\). During this process the water will be transported to a height of \(30\) \(m\) above the pump. In addition the minor and frictional head losses associated with this process are \(5\) \(m\) and \(10\) \(m\) respectively. If the power input to the pump is \(0.8\) \(MW\) what should be the minimum efficiency of the pump, at this flow rate, in order to sustain this process?

Efficiency = P to fluid / Pin

P to fluid = rho g Q H

H = 30 m + 5 m + 10 m = 45 m
Q = 1500 L/s
= 1.5 m^3/s

P to fluid = (998 kg/m^3)(9.81 m/s^2)(1.5 m^3/s)(45 m)
= 661 kW

P in = 0.8 MW = 800 kW

Minimum Efficiency = 661 kW / 800 kW
= 82.6 %
