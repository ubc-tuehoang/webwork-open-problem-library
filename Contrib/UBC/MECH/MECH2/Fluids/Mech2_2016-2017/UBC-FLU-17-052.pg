BEGIN_PGML

Consider a rectangular foam boat [`[$w]`] [`cm`] wide by [`[$l]`] [`cm`] long by [`[$d]`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`[$wl]`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Estimate the maximum speed (i.e. steady state speed) of the boat if the driving mass is [`[$dm]`] [`g`]. Assume that the towline length is not a factor, kinematic viscosity is [`1.15\times 10^{-6}`] [`m^2/s`], and density of water is [`\rho=1000`] [`kg/m^3`].

This is a difficult quantity to solve for exactly with analytical methods. You may wish to use Excel or MATLAB to solve numerically, or plot the relevant functions to determine this graphically.
