BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`[$w]`] [`cm`] wide by [`[$l]`] [`cm`] long by [`[$d]`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`[$wl]`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Determine the expected wave drag force if the boat moves at [`[$v]`] [`m/s`] (assuming the relationship in the lab manual for wave drag holds true and density of water is [`\rho=1000`] [`kg/m^3`]).

[`F_w=`] [_____]{"$fw"} [`N`]
