BEGIN_PGML
A thin flat plate measuring  [`[$a]`] [`cm`] x [`[$a]`] [`cm`] is pulled horizontally at [`v_1=`]  [`[$b]`] [`m/s`] through a [`3.6`] [`mm`] thick oil layer sandwiched between two plates, one stationary and the other moving at a constant velocity of [`v_2=`] [`[$c]`] [`m/s`], as shown in the figure below.  

>> [@ image("UBC-FLU-17-106.png", height=>[$height], width=>[$width]) @]* <<

The dynamic viscosity of the oil is [`[$d] Pa\cdot s`].  Assuming the velocity of each oil layer to vary linearly, determine the force that needs to be applied to the plate to maintain this motion.
