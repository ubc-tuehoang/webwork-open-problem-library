Liquid ammonia (\(\rho\) \(= 682 kg/m^3 \)) is to be transferred from an underwater storage tank, located \(100 m\) under water, to a surface storage reservoir. What pressure, \(P_{r}\), in the surface reservoir would be needed to maintain a flow rate of \(25 m^3/hr\) of ammonia? The transfer pipe is \(5 cm\) in diameter and the length is \(125 m\). The underwater tank is at local hydrostatic pressure, \(P_{U}\). Neglect friction in the transfer pipe.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
First compute local hydrostatic pressure around the underwater tank$PAR
\(P_{U} = \rho_{water} g z \)$PAR
\(= (998)(9.81)(100 m) \)$PAR
\(= 979 kPa \)$PAR

Next determine flow speed in the transfer pipe$PAR
\(U = \frac{Q}{A} \)$PAR
\(= \frac{(25 m^3/hr)(\frac{1}{3600} hr/s)} {(\frac{\pi}{4} (0.05 m)^2)} \)$PAR
\(= 3.54 m/s \)$PAR
 
Finally, use Bernoulli's equation to determine required surface pressure$PAR
\(P_{r} = P_{U} + \frac{1}{2} \rho_{ammonia} U^2 + \rho_{ammonia} g(-d) - \frac{1}{2} \rho_{ammonia} U_{r}^2 \)$PAR
 
but if the surface tank is large, we can approximate \(U_{r} = 0 \).$PAR
 
\(P_{r} = 979,000 Pa + \frac{1}{2} (682) (3.54)^2 + (682)(9.81)(-100) \)$PAR
\(= 314 kPa \)
