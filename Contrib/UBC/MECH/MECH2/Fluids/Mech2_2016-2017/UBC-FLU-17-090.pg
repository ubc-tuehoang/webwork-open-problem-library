BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the apparatus used in this experiment. If you were to double one of the parameters below, which one would you choose to cause the greatest increase in discharge rate out of the tube? Assume all other parameters remain the same and that Bernoulli's equation is appropriate for modelling the system.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Rearranging Bernoulli's equation (in the form of Equation 2 in the lab manual) with Point 1 at the tank surface and Point 2 at the tube exit gives:

 
\(U_{2} = (2 g z_{1})^\frac{1}{2} \)

 
This assumes the tank is much larger than the tube (i.e. \(U_{1}\) is approximately 0) and there are no losses. The only way to increase discharge rate is by increaseing the water level, \(z_{1}\).
