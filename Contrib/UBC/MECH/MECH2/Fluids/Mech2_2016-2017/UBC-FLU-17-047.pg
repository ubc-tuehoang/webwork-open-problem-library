BEGIN_PGML

Determine how high above the waterline the bottom of one [`[$m]`] [`g`] block of cargo would be supported with the following conditions: the cargo block is placed on its side (length of [`[$l]`] [`cm`], width and height of [`[$w]`] [`cm`]), a block of foam ([`\rho=`] [`[$rho]`] [`kg/m^3`]) on which the cargo rests is [`[$hc]`] [`cm`] high, and, when viewed from above, there is [`[$pad]`] [`cm`] of foam around all edges of the cargo block.

[`h=`] [_____]{"$h"} [`cm`]
