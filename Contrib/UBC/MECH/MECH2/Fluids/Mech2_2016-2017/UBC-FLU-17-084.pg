$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Given that head expresses energy per weight of fluid, the energy (and head) will only go up if we add energy to the flow. It takes a pump or other similar device to acheive this. Without adding energy, head will stay constant (if there are no losses) or go down (if there are losses), even if there are velocity, pressure, or elevation changes.
