BEGIN_TEXT
In order to obtain suction in a tube, the tube is connected to the side of a water pipe with water flowing. The flow rate in the pipe is controlled by a valve. If more suction is needed, how should the valve on the pipe be adjusted?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
As the flow velocity increases, the pressure decreases (elevation does not change). See equation 3 in the lab manual. As a result, for more suction (decreased pressure) the discharge rate must be increased and the valve must be opened.
