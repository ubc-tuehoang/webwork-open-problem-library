BEGIN_PGML
The two sides of a V-shaped water trough are hinged to each other at the bottom where they meet, as shown in the figure, making an angle of [`45^{\circ}`] with the ground from both sides. Each side is  [`L=[$a]`] [`m`] wide, and the two parts are held together by a cable and turnbuckle placed every  [`[$b]`] [`m`] along the length of the trough. Calculate the tension in each cable when the trough is filled to the rim.
