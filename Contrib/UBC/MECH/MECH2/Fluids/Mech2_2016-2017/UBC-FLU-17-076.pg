BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you are designing an artificial cardiovascular system which includes a pump as one of its components. The density of blood is slightly higher than water (\(1050\) \(kg/m^3\)). At maximum operating conditions this pump will be required to deliver a pressure increase of \(600\) \(mmHg\). The required flow rate is \(7\) \(L/min\). What will be the required power input to the pump if it is \(78%\) efficient at these operating conditions?
