BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`[$w]`] [`cm`] wide by [`[$l]`] [`cm`] long by [`[$d]`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`[$wl]`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Determine the friction drag force if the boat moves at [`[$v]`] [`m/s`] and the kinematic viscosity and density of water is [`1.15\times 10^{-6}`] [`m^2/s`] and [`\rho=1000`] [`kg/m^3`], respectively.
