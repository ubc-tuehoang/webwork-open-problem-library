A channel is blocked by a rectangular gate [`[$w]`] [`m`] wide and [`[$h]`] [`m`] tall. This gate is pinned at point [`A`] and restrained from opening by the ridge at point [`B`], as shown in the following figure. If the water level in the channel is [`[$d]`] [`m`], calculate the reaction force at the ridge.

[`F_B= `] [____]{"$fB"} [`kN`]
