A tank is filled with oil with the density of [`[$rho]`] [`kg/m^3`] and kinematic viscosity of [`6.2\times 10^{-4}`] [`m^2/s`]. The oil is being discharged from the tank by a [`[$d]`] [`mm`] diameter pipe [`[$L]`] [`m`] long. Calculate the volumetric flow rate of oil when its height in the tank is [`[$h]`] [`m`]. Assume all losses are negligible.

[`\dot{V}= `] [____]{"$flow"} [`m^3/kg`]
