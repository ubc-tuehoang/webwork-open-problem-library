An elbow pipe is used to discharge water and change its flow direction. The flow rate is [`[$A]`] [`kg/s`] and the pipe is [`[$B]`] [`cm`] in diameter. The elevation gain between the center of the pipe's of the inlet and outlet is [`[$C]`] [`cm`]. Calculate the gage pressure of the inlet as well as the force required to hold the elbow in place. Assume that the momentum flux correction factor, water density, and atmospheric pressure are [`1`], [`1000`] [`kg/m^3`], and [`100`] [`kPa`], respectively.

[`P_g=`] [_____]{"$pgInlet"} [`kPa`]  
[`F_{total}=`] [_____]{"$fTotal"} [`N`]
