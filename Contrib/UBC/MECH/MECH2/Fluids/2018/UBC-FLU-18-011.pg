BEGIN_PGML

An oceanographic profiling instrument was pressure tested up to [`15,000`] [`psig`]. After reviewing the test chamber pressure data, you notice a slight drop in pressure at a test pressure of [`[$LeakPressureTmp]`] [`psig`], which you surmise is due to the test chamber fluid leaking into the instrument. What is the maximum oceanwater depth above which this instrument can safely operate?

At significant depths, the density of ocean water is approximately [`1028`] [`kg/m^3`].

[`d=`] [_____]{"$Ans"} [`km`]
