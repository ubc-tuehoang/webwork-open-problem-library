Concrete is poured into a mold to create a section of a wall with a height [`H = [$Height]`] [`m`], width [`W = [$Width]`] [`m`], and length [`L = [$Length]`] [`m`] (into the page). Each side wall of the mold is supported by a single truss as shown in the figure.

1. Assuming that the ground provides no friction support to the mold side walls, determine the required vertical location of the truss contact point with the mold (represented by [`y`] in the figure) in order to prevent the mold side walls from tipping over. The specific gravity of concrete before setting is [`2.4`].
2. With the trusses contacting the mold side walls at this location, determine the horizontal force required to maintain the positions of the trusses.
