Flow is generated between two horizontal flat plates by holding the bottom plate fixed and moving the top plate in the positive [`x`] direction at a speed [`U_0 = [$PlateSpeed]`] [`m/s`]. As a result, the fluid velocity in the [`x`] direction varies linearly from zero at the bottom plate, to [`[$PlateSpeed]`] [`m/s`] at the top plate. The distance between the plates is [`H = [$Height]`] [`m`], and the fluid within the control volume is water at a temperature of [`20^{\circ}C`].

Determine the shear force-per-unit-width (the width is measured into the page) acting on the bottom plate for an area spanning from [`x = 0`] to [`L = [$Length]`] [`m`].
