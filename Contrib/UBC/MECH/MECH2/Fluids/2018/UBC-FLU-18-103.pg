BEGIN_PGML

As part of an experimental setup, a small circulation pump must deliver [`[$FlowRateTmp]`] [`L/min`] of water to a heat exchanger located [`[$Height]`] [`m`] directly above the pump and fluid reservoir. The connecting tube diameter is [`[$PipeDiaTmp]`] [`in`]. Given that the supply water temperature may range from [`10^{\circ}`] to [`60^{\circ}C`], determine the minimum acceptable head capacity of the pump in [`kPa`]. The pressure drop across the heat exchanger at this flowrate is [`[$HeatExPressTmp]`] [`kPa`].
