The experimental setup shown in the figure consists of a pump in series with a gate valve, two heat exchangers (one for adding heat to the fluid and one for cooling), two thermocouples for measuring the fluid temperature before and after the first heat exchanger, and three elbows. Flow resistance coefficients at the desired steady-state flowrate for all components are shown in the figure. Your goal is to determine the minimum pump head capacity in [`kPa`] that will maintain steady flow operation.

The desired steady flowrate is [`[$FlowRateTmp]`] [`L/min`] and the tube diameter is [`[$TubeDiaTmp]`] [`in`]. The total length of tubing is [`[$TubeLength]`] [`m`]. The temperature of the circulating water will vary from [`20^{\circ}`] to [`90^{\circ}C`] as it flows past the first heat exchanger; then back to [`20^{\circ}C`] as it flows past the second heat exchanger. One approach to determining the required specification of the pump would be to consider this temperature variation in your calculation. A much simpler approach, which would also lead to a more robust design, would be to assume that the entirety of the system operates at a single temperature that maximizes the pump's required head capacity. Use this second approach and give some thought to which end of the operating temperature range requires the greatest pump capacity.
