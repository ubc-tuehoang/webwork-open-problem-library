A medicinal fluid is delivered to a medical device at a flowrate of [`[$FlowRateTmp]`] [`L/min`] via the tubing system shown in the figure. The diameter of tube segment [`1`] (inlet) is [`[$TubeDia1Tmp]`] [`in`]. This segment then branches into two segments with diameters [`[$TubeDia2Tmp]`] [`in`] (segment [`2`]) and [`[$TubeDia3Tmp]`] [`in`] (segment [`3`]). The fourth (outlet) segment has the same diameter as the inlet segment. The flowmeter attached inline with tube segment [`2`] yields a pressure drop of [`4`] [`kPa`] at the given flowrate. Flow resistance coefficient for the remaining components are shown (note that tees possess different resistance coefficients for their inline and branch segments). Determine the working pressure drop that must be counteracted by a pump to maintain the desired flowrate. The density and kinematic viscosity of the medicinal fluid are [`1,200`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`0.025`] [`Pa\cdot s`], respectively. The total tube lengths in each segment are [`L_1 = 0.1`] [`m`], [`L_2 = 0.6`] [`m`], [`L_3 = 0.7`] [`m`], and [`L_4 = 0.1`] [`m`]. The device is shown in the horizontal plane; therefore there is no change in fluid elevation.
