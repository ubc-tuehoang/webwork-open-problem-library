BEGIN_PGML

The [`x`] and [`y`] components of an incompressible velocity field are described by the following expression:

>>[``u=3xt \ m/s``]<<  
>>[``v=yz^2  \ m/s``]<<

Determine the [`x`] component of velocity [`w`] at [`(x, y, z, t) = ([$x]\ m, [$y]\ m, [$z]\ m, [$t]\ s)`], if given that when [`z = 0`] [`m`] and [`t = 0`] [`s`], then [`w = 0`] [`m/s`].

[`x=`] [____]{"$Ans"} [`m/s`]
