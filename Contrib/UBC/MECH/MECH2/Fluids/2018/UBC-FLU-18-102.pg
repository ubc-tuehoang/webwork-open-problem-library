BEGIN_PGML

Water at [`20^{\circ}C`] enters a [`[$TubeDiaTmp]`] [`in`] diameter tube from a reservoir at an average velocity of [`[$AvgVel]`] [`m/s`] and is fed to some experimental process. If this process requires fully-developed flow, what is the minimum tube length that is needed between the reservoir outlet and process inlet?

[`L=`] [____] [`m`]

_Hint: Assume that the flow is laminar for [`Re < 2300`] and turbulent otherwise._
