A micro or minichannel heatsink is a type of liquid cooled heatsink that is commonly used for cooling CPUs in high performance computing applications. A typical design consists of rectangular channels that less than [`0.5`] [`mm`] thick and less than [`2.0`] [`mm`] tall. The coolant of choice is generally water due its high density and thermal capacitance. As an example, IBM's supercomputing system Aquasar uses water cooled microchannel heatsinks to prevent server CPUs from over heating. Due to the superb thermal performance of these heatsinks, IBM is able to use hot inlet water at [`50^{\circ}C`] to maintain the temperature of the supercomputer's CPUs below [`85^{\circ}C`] with a flowrate of [`1.0`] [`L/min`].

For these operating conditions, estimate the pressure drop across the microchannel heatsink with the geometry shown in the figure. This image represents a top view of the heatsink with its cover removed. The inlet and outlet manifolds provide a space for water to accumulate and distribute across the different channels. The pressure drop across these regions is negligible. The channels are [`[$ChannelWidthTmp]`] [`mm`] wide, [`[$ChannelHeightTmp]`] [`mm`] tall, and [`3.0`] [`cm`] long. The fins are of the same width as the channels. The thinner the microchannels are, the greater the flow resistance and the more even the distribution of flow across the different channels becomes. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the flowrate is equally divided across all channels. The total width of the flow area [`W`] is [`[$BaseWidthTmp]`] [`cm`].
