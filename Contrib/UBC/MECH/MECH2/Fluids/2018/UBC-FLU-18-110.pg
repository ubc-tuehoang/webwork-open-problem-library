You work for a company that manufactures needle valves and part of your job involves determining the fully open flow resistance coefficients for each design. You design the simple experimental setup shown in the figure. A needle valve is attached inline with [`[$PipeDiaTmp]`] [`in`]. pipes carrying water at [`20^{\circ}C`]. You measure the fluid pressure directly before and after needle valve. The readings are [`P_1 = [$Pressure1Tmp]`] [`kPa`] and [`P_2 = [$Pressure2Tmp]`] [`kPa`]. Further downstream, a flowmeter measures the flowrate to be [`[$FlowRateTmp]`] [`L/min`]. Datasheets provided by the manufacturer show that the flowmeter yields a pressure drop of [`10`] [`kPa`] at this flowrate. The pipe length between the ball valve and the flowmeter is [`2`] [`m`]. Determine the flow resistance coefficient of the needle valve.
