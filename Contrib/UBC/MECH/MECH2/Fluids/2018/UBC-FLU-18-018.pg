The underwater viewing window of a dolphin aquarium is rectangular and has a width [`W = [$Width]`] [`m`] (into the page), height [`H = [$Height]`] [`m`], and thickness [`t`]. The window is located such that its top edge is [`h = [$Depth]`] [`m`] below the water surface. As a poor design choice, the window is bonded to the walls of the aquarium along its top, bottom, and side surfaces (all surfaces except the two that are necessary for viewing the dolphins). This bonded contact can withstand a maximum shear stress of [`[$MaxShearStressTmp]`] [`MPa`]. Omitting the strength of the glass itself from this analysis, determine the appropriate window thickness if the safety factor for this design is [`[$SafetyFactor]`]. The water density inside the aquarium is [`1025`] [`kg/m^3`].
