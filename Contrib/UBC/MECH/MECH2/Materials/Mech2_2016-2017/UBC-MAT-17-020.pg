A structural component in the form of a wide plate is to be fabricated from a steel alloy that has a plane strain fracture toughness \((K_{Ic})\) of \(98.9\) \(MPa\) \(m^{1/2}\) and a yield strength \((\sigma_y)\) of \(860\) \(MPa\). The flaw size resolution limit \((F)\) of the flaw detection apparatus is \(3.0\) \(mm\). If the design stress is one-half the yield strength and the value of \(Y\) is \(1.0\), determine whether or not a critical flaw for this plate is subject to detection.
