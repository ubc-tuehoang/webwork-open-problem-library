A motorcyclist starts its ride from rest at point [`A`] and leaves the leaves the left ship's deck at [`[$theta]^{\circ}`] and with a velocity of [`[$V1]`] [`m/s`]. Use the following assumptions and calculate the velocity of the ship on the right (relative to the left ship) just after the motorcycle comes to rest at point [`B`].  
	[`\cdot`] The mass of each ship is [`[$M]`] metric tons.  
	[`\cdot`] The total mass of the motorcycle and the motorcyclist is [`[$m]`] [`kg`].  
	[`\cdot`] Neglect any friction and energy loss.  
	[`\cdot`] Both ships are freely floating in the ocean.

[`V_2 = `][____]{"$V2"} [`mm/s`]
