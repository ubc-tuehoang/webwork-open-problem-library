A self-driving car made by company [`G`] is programed to always keep its distance from the rear of a non-self driving (NSD) by [`15`] [`m`]. Another self-driving car made by company [`T`] is programed to always keep its distance from the front of an NSD by [`20`] [`m`]. 

Consider a case where the distance between [`G`] and [`T`] is decreasing at a rate of [`[$VTG]`] [`m/s`], [`a = 9`] [`m`] and [`b = 12`] [`m`]. Determine the velocity of the NSD.

[`V_{NSD}=`][____]{"$V"} [`m/s`]
