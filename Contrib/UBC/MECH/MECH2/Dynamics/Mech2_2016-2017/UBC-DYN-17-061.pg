BEGIN_TEXT

A spring-mass-damper system has a mass of \($m\) \(kg\), stiffness of \($K\) \(N/m\) and damping coefficient of \($c\) \(Ns/m\). The system is: $PAR
(1) overdamped $BR
(2) underdamped $BR
(3) critically damped $PAR

(Enter the numeric index of the correct answer in the solution box) $BR
