Consider the mechanism shown. \(AB\) is \($L1\) \(m\) long. \(BC\) is \($L2\) \(m\) long. The angle \(\theta\) is \($theta\)\(^{\circ}\). \(AB\) and \(BC\) are currently at an angle of \(90^{\circ}\). Peg \(C\) is constrained to move along the \(x\) direction. If peg \(C\) is moving with velocity \($vc\) \(m/s\) \(i\), find \(\omega_{BC}\). Give a positive response to indicate the rotation direction is counter-clockwise, or a negative response to indicate clockwise rotation.
