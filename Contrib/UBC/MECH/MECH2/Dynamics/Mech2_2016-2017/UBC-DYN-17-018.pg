$PAR
The bullet with horizontal velocity of \(V_m = $Vm\) \(m/s\) strikes the compound pendulum when it was in the rest. The compound pendulum and the bullet have \(M =\) \($Mass_1\) \(kg\) and \(m = $mass_2\) \(g\), respectively. Determine the angular velocity of the compound pendulum and the bullet immediately after the strike which causes the bullet to be embedded in the pendulum. The radius of gyration of the pendulum is \(K_O =$Ko\) \(cm\) around point \(O\). 
Also calculate the following parameters:
Angular momentum of the bullet before the strike \(H_{bullet}\),
Angular momentum of the pendulum before the strike \(H_{pendulum}\),
Mass moment of inertia of both of the bullet and pendulum around point \(O\) (\(I_O\)).
