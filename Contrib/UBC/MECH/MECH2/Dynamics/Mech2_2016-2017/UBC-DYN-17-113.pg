The man stands on the platform at \(O\) and runs out toward the edge such that when he is at \(A\), his mass center has a velocity of \($v\) \(ft/s\) and an acceleration of \($a\) \(ft/s^2\), both measured relative to the platform and directed along the positive \(y\) axis. If the platform has the angular motions shown, determine the magnitude of the velocity of his mass center.
