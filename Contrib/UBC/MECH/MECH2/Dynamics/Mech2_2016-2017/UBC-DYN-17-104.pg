BEGIN_TEXT	
A solid bar of length \(L = 0.5\) \(m\) and with \(W = 0.1\) \(m\) weighs \(2\) \(kg\). It also has two constant-thrust rockets attached on either end. Each rocket is small enough to be considered a point mass of \(0.25\) \(kg\). If the bar is initially at rest and in two seconds after the rockets are fired it achieves a rotation rate of \(1000\) \(rpm\), determine the thrust of each rocket.
