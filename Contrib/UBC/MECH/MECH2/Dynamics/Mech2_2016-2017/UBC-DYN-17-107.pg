Gear \(C\) has radius \($rc\) \(m\) and rotates with angular velocity \($wc\) \(rad/s\). The connecting link rotates at angular velocity \($wcd\) \(rad/s\). Gear \(D\) has radius \($rd\) \(m\). Find the angular velocity of gear \(D\) (in \(rad/s\)). Note that gear \(C\) is pinned to ground and gear \(D\) is a planetary gear. Give a positive response to indicate the rotation direction is counter-clockwise, or a negative response to indicate clockwise rotation.
