Viscous damping is not an accurate representation of the resistance experienced by a body that is moving through a low-viscosity fluid such as air or water. Experiments indicate that the damping force is proportional to the square of the velocity. For a simple pendulum consisting of a 25 mm sphere of mass 70 g attached to a 0.5 m long massless link the equation of motion is:
