A mass hanging on a spring oscillates with a natural frequency of \($w\) \(rad/sec\). If initially it is displaced \($s\) \(m\) in the positive direction from equilibrium and given negative initial velocity of \($v\) \(m/s\), determine the position of the mass (in \(m\)) after \($t\) \(s\). Assume up is the positive direction.
