BEGIN_PGML

It can be shown that, for an ideal compressor operating at steady state, the specific work input required, [`w_\text{in}`] is [`\int_\text{in}^\text{out} v\,\text{d}P`] (note: although this looks like the expression for boundary work, [`P`] and [`v`] are in the opposite positions). Consider an ideal compressor at steady state which is pressurizing helium from [`[$P1]\,\text{bar}`], [`[$T1]\,^\circ\text{C}`] to [`[$P2]\,\text{MPa}`]. What is the specific work input required to power the compressor if

a. the compression process is fast
b. the compression process is slow and/or the compressor is actively cooled by surrounding air at [`[$T1]\,^\circ\text{C}`]

You may assume that the specific heat of helium at any temperature is the same as that at [`25\,^\circ\text{C}`].

*Answers*:

a. [`w_\text{in} = `][_________]{$Wfast} [`\text{kJ/kg}`] (answer tolerance: [`1\,\text{kJ/kg}`]) 
c. [`w_\text{in} = `][_________]{$Wslow} [`\text{kJ/kg}`] (answer tolerance: [`1\,\text{kJ/kg}`])
