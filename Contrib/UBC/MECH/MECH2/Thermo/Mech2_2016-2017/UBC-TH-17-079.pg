BEGIN_PGML
An air tank used for scuba diving contains air at [` [$P1] \ \text{kPa}`] and a temperature of [` [$T1]^{\ \circ} \text{C}`]. The tank is placed outside and it cools to [` [$T2]^{\ \circ} \text{C}`]. What is the resulting pressure inside the tank (in [`\text{kPa}`])? Assume ideal gas conditions. [__________]{$P2}
