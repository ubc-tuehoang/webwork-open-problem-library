BEGIN_PGML

Solid [`\text{CO}_2`] ("dry ice") can exist in equilibrium with gaseous [`\text{CO}_2`] (for example, at [`1\,\text{atm}`] this equilibrium occurs at [`194.65\,\text{K}`] ([`-78.5\,^\circ\text{C}`])). For a sample of pure [`\text{CO}_2`] in a state of solid-vapour equilibrium:

a) How many degrees of freedom are associated with the *state*?
b) How many degrees of freedom are associated with the *extent*?

*Answers:*

    a) [_]{1} degrees of freedom in state
    b) [_]{2} degrees of freedom in extent
