BEGIN_PGML
Suppose air at approximately [` [$T] \ \text{K} `] is compressed isothermally to a pressure of approximately [` [$P] \ \text{kPa}`]. The uncertainty in the initial temperature is [`\pm [$dT] \ \text{K}`] and the uncertainty in the final pressure is [` \pm [$dP] \ \text{kPa} `]. The uncertainty in the air density at the end of the compression is [`\pm`][__________]{$d_rho} [`\text{kg/m}^3`]. (Hint: use the error propagation approach from the lab manual.)
