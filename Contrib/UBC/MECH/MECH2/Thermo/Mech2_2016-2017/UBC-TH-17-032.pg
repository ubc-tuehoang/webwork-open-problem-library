BEGIN_PGML

Dry (moisture-free) air can be approximated as a homogeneous mixture of [`\text{N}_2`], [`\text{O}_2`], and [`\text{Ar}`] in predefined proportions: [`78\,\%\ \text{N}_2`], [`21\,\%\ \text{O}_2`], and [`1\,\%\ \text{Ar}`] (by volume).

1. How many independent properties are required to define the *state* of a homogeneous mixture of [`\text{N}_2`], [`\text{O}_2`], and [`\text{Ar}`]...
    a) ...in *arbitrary* proportions
    b) ...in *defined* proportions (e.g., air)
2. How many *independent* properties are defined by the fact that air is [`78\,\%\ \text{N}_2`], [`21\,\%\ \text{O}_2`], and [`1\,\%\ \text{Ar}`] (by volume).

*Answers:*

1. State defined by...
    a) [_]{4} independent properties
    b) [_]{2} independent properties
2. Proportions define [_]{2} independent properties
