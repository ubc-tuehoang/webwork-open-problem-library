BEGIN_TEXT

A sealed piston-cylinder arrangement filled with air is compressed. The compression is not fast enough to be adiabatic, but not slow enough to be isothermal; heat is exchanged with the surrounding atmosphere. The system is chosen as the air inside the piston-cylinder, and it is reasonable to assign this system a single \(T\) and \(P\) at each point in the process.
