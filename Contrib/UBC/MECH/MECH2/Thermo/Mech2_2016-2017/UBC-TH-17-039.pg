BEGIN_PGML
The air inside a hot air balloon envelope has a roughly uniform pressure near [`1\,\text{atm}`] and a roughly uniform temperature near [`[$TH]\,^\circ\text{C}`]. Suppose that an uncomfortable passenger begins vomiting over the edge of the basket at a rate of [`[$V]\,\text{kg}/\text{min}`]. The vomit leaving the basket reduces the mass of the balloon and its contents, so to prevent the balloon from rising the operator vents (releases) hot air from the envelope. The hot air is replaced by cooler air at [`T = [$TL]\,^\circ\text{C}`]. What rate of venting is required to keep the total weight of the balloon plus its contents (air, passengers, and as-yet-unexpelled stomach contents) constant? Assume that the air entering at the bottom of the balloon envelope does not mix or exchange heat with the air already in the envelope.

Vent Rate: [_________]{$X} [`\text{m}^3/\text{s}`]
