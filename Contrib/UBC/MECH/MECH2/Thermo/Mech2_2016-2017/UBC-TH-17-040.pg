BEGIN_PGML
Coal is delivered to a power plant at an average rate of [`[$C]\,\text{kg}/\text{s}`]. For each kilogram of coal brought in, the plant also sucks in about [`11.8\,\text{kg}`] of air to serve as oxidizer for combustion . The combustion produces exhaust gases and ash. If the [`[$A]\,\text{t}`] (tonnes) of ash are produced of per day, what is the average rate at which exhaust gases leave the plant? 

Exhaust Flux: [_________]{$X} [`\text{kg}/\text{s}`]
