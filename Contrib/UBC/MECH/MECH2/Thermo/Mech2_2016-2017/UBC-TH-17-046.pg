BEGIN_PGML
Standard automobile engines extract work from hot combustion products. The combustion products (which can be approximated as hot air) expand inside cylinders and do work on pistons. In some engine, the contents of a single cylinder following combustion can be approximated as air at [`P = [$P1]\,\text{MPa}`] and the cylinder volume is [`V = [$V1]\,\text{cm}^3`]. The piston expands (without losing or gaining mass) to a final volume of [`V = [$V2]\,\text{cm}^3`]; this process occurs very quickly, and the [`P`]-[`V`] relationship can be modelled by the equation [`P = (P_0 V_0^{1.4}) V^{-1.4}`]. 

a. How much work is extracted from the expanding gases?
b. For a control mass chosen as the system contents, how much flow work is done over the process?

*Answers:*

a. Total Work Extracted [_________]{$W} [`\text{J}`]
b. Flow Work [_________]{0} [`\text{J}`]
