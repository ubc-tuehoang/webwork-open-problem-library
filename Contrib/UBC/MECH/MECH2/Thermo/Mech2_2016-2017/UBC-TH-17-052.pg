BEGIN_PGML

Compressed gas cylinders store a lot of energy. Consider a [`[$V1]\,\text{L}`] cylinder filled with argon at [`[$P1]\,\text{bar}`], [`25\,^\circ\text{C}`]. You may assume that the specific heat of argon at any temperature is the same as that [`25\,^\circ\text{C}`]. 

a. How much boundary work could this gas do if we allowed it to rapidly expand until its pressure dropped to atmospheric pressure [`P_\text{atm} = 100\,\text{kPa}`]?
b. If we carried out the process described above, what would the final temperature of the gas be? (Note: the temperature of a gas can drop a great deal when it expands)

*Answers*: 

a. [`W_\text{boundary}= `][_________]{$W} [`\text{kJ}`] (answer tolerance: [`3\,\text{kJ}`])
c. [`T_2 = `][_________]{$T2} [`\,^\circ\text{C}`] (answer tolerance: [`0.5\,^\circ\text{C}`])
