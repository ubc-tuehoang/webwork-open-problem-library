BEGIN_PGML
A [`[$V]\text{-L}`] kettle contains a mixture of liquid and vapour at [`P=100\,\text{kPa}`]. Initially, the mixture is [`[$XV*100]\,%`] liquid by volume.

a. What is the initial quality?  [_________]{$X} 
b. How long does it take for all of the liquid to boil, if vapour leaves at [`[$R]\,\text{mL}/\text{s}`] and the pressure stays constant within the kettle? [_________]{$t} [`\text{min}`]
