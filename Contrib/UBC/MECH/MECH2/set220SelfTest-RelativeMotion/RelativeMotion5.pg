BEGIN_TEXT
Collar \(A\) slides along a shaft \(OD\). Shaft \(OD\) has a pin connection at \(O\) and is rotating counter-clockwise with angular velocity \(\omega\). Link \(AB\) is connected to collar \(A\) with a pin joint. How many degrees of freedom does this system have relative to ground? (Note: \(OD\) is a cylindrical shaft and \(A\) is a cylindrical collar.)
