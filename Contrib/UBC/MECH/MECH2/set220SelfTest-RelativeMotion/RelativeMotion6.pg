BEGIN_TEXT
Collar \(A\) slides along a shaft \(OD\). Shaft \(OD\) has a pin connection at \(O\) and is rotating counter-clockwise with angular velocity \(\omega\). Link \(AB\) is connected to collar \(A\) with a pin joint. The location of collar \(A\) along \(OD\) is described by \(s\), and \(OD\) and \(AB\) are oriented to the horizontal by angles \(\alpha\) and \(\theta\) respectively, as shown. The length of \(OD\) is \(2\) \(m\). At the instant shown, \(s = 0.5\) \(m\) and is moving towards \(D\) at \(2\) \(m/s\), \(\alpha = 0.15\) radians, \(\theta = 0.25\) radians, and \(\omega = 5\) radians per second. If \(\theta\) is growing at a rate of \(2\) radians per second, what is the velocity of \(B\)?
