A \(80\) \(kg\) man is trying to pull a \(5\) \(kg\) box up a \(37^{\circ}\) slope. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the ground is \(0.45\) and the coefficient of sliding friction is \(0.40\). The man standing on carpet which gives a coefficient of static friction of \(0.60\) and coefficient sliding friction of \(0.50\) to the ground. What will be the tension in the rope?
