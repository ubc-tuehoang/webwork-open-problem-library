BEGIN_TEXT
A balance supported by a thin string is shown below. A distributed force is applied on the right side of the balance, with linear variation from \(0\) \(N/m \) (at 2 metres from the string) to \(10\) \(N/m\) (3 metres from the string). What mass \(M\) must be hung from the left side to keep the balance horizontal?
