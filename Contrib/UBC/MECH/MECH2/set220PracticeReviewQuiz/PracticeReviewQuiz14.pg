BEGIN_TEXT
As shown below, a package is dropped from a plane that is gaining altitude at an angle of \(30\) degrees to horizontal, with a speed of \(50\) \(m/s\), at an current altitude of \(h = 500\) \(m\). 
$PAR
\{ image( "220-practice-13q.png", width=>350, height=>378) \}
$PAR
Neglecting air resistance, what is the velocity of the package at the instant it is dropped from the plane in the \((x,y)\) coordinate frame? 
$PAR
\{ $mc->buttons() \}
