BEGIN_TEXT

A sling holds a stone and is spun at a rate of \(500\) \(rpm\) in a plane perpendicular to the ground. The sling is \(0.8\) \(m\) long and is made from rope. At time \(t = 0\), just as the stone crosses the x axis, the rope is cut. What are the x and y coordinates of the stone \(0.01\) seconds later? Neglect air friction and gravity.
