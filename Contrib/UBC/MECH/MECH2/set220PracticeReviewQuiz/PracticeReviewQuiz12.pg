BEGIN_TEXT

A cylindrical air bearing is made by taking a fixed porous rod and fitting around it a slightly oversized sleeve. Air is forced out through the pores in the rod, causing the sleeve to ride on a thin air cushion. Which of the following is the most complete description of what can be said about the forces and moments that the rod imposes on the sleeve?
