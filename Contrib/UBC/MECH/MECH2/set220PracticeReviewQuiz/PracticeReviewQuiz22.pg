BEGIN_TEXT
A person with a weight of \(650\) \(N\) stands on a platform of negligible weight and length \(3\) \(m\), supported at each end by a single string. Each string will fail if the force acting on it exceeds \(500\) \(N\). In what part of the platform (with x measured in metres) can the person safely stand?
