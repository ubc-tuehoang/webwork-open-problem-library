BEGIN_TEXT

A ring of extremely dense material has a mass \(M\) and a radius \(R\). It spins at angular velocity \(w\) \(rad/s\). What is the kinetic energy, \(KE\), stored in the ring? (Hint: start with the kinetic energy of a small particle translating at velocity, \(V\), and integrate to form the ring rotating at angular velocity, \(w\).)
