BEGIN_TEXT

The rotation of the \(0.9 m\) arm \(OA\) about \(O\) is defined by the relation \(\theta = 0.15t^2\), where \(\theta\) is expressed in radians and \(t\) in seconds. Collar \(B\) slides along the arm in such a way that its distance to \(O\) is \(r = 0.9 - 0.12t^2\), where \(r\) is expressed in meters and \(t\) in seconds. After the arm \(OA\) has rotated through \(30\) degrees, determine the total velocity of the collar.
