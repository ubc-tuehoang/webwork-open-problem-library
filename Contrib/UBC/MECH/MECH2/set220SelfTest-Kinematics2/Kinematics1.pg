BEGIN_TEXT

A bus starts from rest at point A and accelerates at a rate of \(0.8\) \(m/s^2\) until it reaches a speed of \(12\) \(m/s\). It then proceeds at \(12\) \(m/s\) until the brakes are applied. Under constant deceleration, it comes to rest at point B. Point B is \(42\) \(m\) beyond the point where the brakes were applied. The distance from A to B is \(300\) \(m\). Determine the time for the bus to travel from A to B.
