BEGIN_TEXT
A ball is projected from point A with a velocity \(v_0 = 10\) \(m/s\). The launch angle is \(15^{\circ}\) less than perpendicular to the incline, as shown. The incline is \(20^{\circ}\) from horizontal. Knowing that the ball strikes the incline at \(B\), determine the range, \(R\), that the ball travels.
