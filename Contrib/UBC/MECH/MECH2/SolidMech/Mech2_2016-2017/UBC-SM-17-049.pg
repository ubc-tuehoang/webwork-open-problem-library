BEGIN_TEXT

A pressurized oil reservoir surrounds the centre section \(BC\) of a metal rod \(AD\). There are O-ring seals at \(B\) and \(C\) to allow the rod to slide longitudinally as needed. The ends of the rod \(A\) and \(D\) are fixed to rigid supports (not shown in the diagram). Lengths \(BC\) and \(AD\) are \(12\) inches and \(20\) inches respectively, and the rod diameter is \(1.5\) inches. \(E = $E \times 10^6\) \(psi\) and \(v = $v\). For an oil pressure \(p = $p\) \(psi\), what is the longitudinal stress in the rod? (If you wish, you may assume that the rod is \(1.5\) inches square instead of circular. The computer will accept either answer.) Give the answer in psi to two decimal points.
