An aluminum rod width \(w = $w\) inches and thickness \(t\) inches, has a \(1\) inch hole drilled through its centre. Determine the required thickness \(t\) so that the rod can support an axial load \(P = $P\) \(lbs\) with a failure stress of \(\sigma = $sigma\) \(psi\) and a safety factor of \($SF\).
