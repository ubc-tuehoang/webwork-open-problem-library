BEGIN_TEXT
A series of tests are conducted in which a simply-supported beam is loaded with a weight of \(10 N\). The beam length is allowed to vary and the deflection at mid-span is measured. The beam has a square cross-section of \( 8 mm \) width and is made of aluminum. Lengths of \(10 cm\), \(15 cm\), \(20 cm\), \( 25 cm\), and \( 30 cm\) are used and the corresponding deflections \( 0.019 mm\), \( 0.065 mm\), \( 0.155 mm\), \( 0.302 mm\), and \( 0.522 mm \) are recorded. Determine an approximate value of the constant \( b \) from Step 2 of the report requirements (ie. determine the exponent \( b \) in deflection formula \( C P^a L^b/(EI) \)).
