BEGIN_TEXT

For a brass alloy, the stress at which plastic deformation begins is \($S\) \(MPa\) and the modulus of elasticity is \($E\) \(GPa\). If the original specimen length is \($lo\) \(mm\), what is the maximum extension without causing plastic deformation?

$PAR

\(\Delta l=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(mm\)
