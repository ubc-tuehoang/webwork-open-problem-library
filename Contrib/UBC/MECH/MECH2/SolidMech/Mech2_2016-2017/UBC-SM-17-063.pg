BEGIN_TEXT

For a brass alloy, the stress at which plastic deformation begins is \($stress\) \(MPa\) and the modulus of elasticity is \($E\) \(GPa\). What is the maximum load that may be applied to a specimen with a cross sectional area of \($A\) \(mm^2\) without plastic deformation?

\(P\)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(kN\)
