BEGIN_TEXT			
The following figure represents stress distribution in samples of equal thickness and under equal loading. Diagram \(A\) shows stress distribution for a sample with a double fillet, \(B\) is stress in a straight bar at mid length, \(C\) is stress in a straight bar close to a point of applied load. Which of the statements that follow is always true?
