BEGIN_TEXT

A pop can of diameter \(D = $D\) \(mm\), length \(L = $L\) \(mm\), and wall thickness \(t = 0.1\) \(mm\) is made of aluminum for which \(E = 70\) \(GPa\) and \(nu=0.33\). The can is filled with a carbonated beverage with a vapour pressure \(p = $p\) \(MPa\). Calculate the change in volume of the contents of the can caused by the pressurization. For simplicity, you may ignore end effects and assume that thin-wall pressure vessel theory applies everywhere.
