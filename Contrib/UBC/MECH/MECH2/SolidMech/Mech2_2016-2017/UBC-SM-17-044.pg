BEGIN_TEXT
A series of tests are conducted in which a simply-supported beam is loaded with a range of weights. The beam length is \( 20 cm \) and it has a square cross-section of \( 8 mm \) width. The beam is steel. Weights of \(10 N\), \(15 N\), \(20 N\), \( 25 N\), and \( 30 N\) are applied to the middle of the beam and deflections of \( 0.155 mm\), \( 0.232 mm\), \( 0.309 mm\), \( 0.386 mm\), and \( 0.464 mm \) are recorded. Determine an approximate value of the constant \( a \) from Step 2 of the report requirements (ie. determine the exponent \( a \) in deflection formula \( C P^a L^b/(EI) \)).
