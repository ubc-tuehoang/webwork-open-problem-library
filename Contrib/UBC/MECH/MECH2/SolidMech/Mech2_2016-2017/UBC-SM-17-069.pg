BEGIN_TEXT

A bolted assembly consists of a steel bolt \(A\), a brass tube \(B\) and a nut \(C\). The nut is turned so that it just secures the tube, and then is tightened one extra turn. Determine the resulting force \(F_s\) in the steel bolt. The initial length of the tube is \(L = $L\) \(mm\), and the screw pitch is \(1\) \(mm\) (the nut moves \(1\) \(mm\) along the bolt for each turn). For the steel bolt, \(E_s = 200\) \(GPa\), \(A_s = $As\) \(mm^2\). For the brass tube, \(E_b = 100\) \(GPa\), \(A_b = $Ab\) \(mm^2\).
