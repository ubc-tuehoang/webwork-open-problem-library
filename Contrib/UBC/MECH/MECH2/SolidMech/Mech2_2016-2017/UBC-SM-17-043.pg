BEGIN_PGML
The deflection at the point of force application for the beam under loading shown below is given by
[``y_p = - \frac{ Px^2 (L - x)^2 }{ 3EIL } ``] where [`L`] is beam length, [`P`] is load, [`x`] is the position of the load.

>> [@ image("UBC-SM-17-043.png", height=>[$height], width=>[$width]) @]* <<

A load of [`[$P] N`] is applied to a stell beam at a position [` x = (4/7) L`]. If the beam has a length of [`[$L] m`] and a rectangular cross section [`[$w] cm`] wide, determine its minimum beam height (in [`mm`]) such that deflection at [`x`] does not exceed [`[$y] m`]. Elastic modulus of steel is [`200 GPa`]. Report your result to three decimal places.  

Minimum beam height = [____________________]{$h} [`mm`]
