Two slabs of polyurethane of identical rectangular cross-section [`L`]x[`w`] = [`[$l]`]x[`[$w]`] [`cm`], and heights [`a=[$a]`] [`cm`] and [`b=[$b]`] [`cm`] are firmly glued on to the two sides of a rigid metal plate. The top and the bottom of the composite block are glued to a fixed rigid top, and a fixed, rigid base, respectively, as shown in the figure above. The plate is constrained to move only in the horizontal direction at a fixed level, by means of a channel mechanism with smooth rollers.
When a horizontal force [`P`] is applied to the metal plate, the associated horizontal movement was found to be [`\delta=[$delta]`] [`mm`]. Taking the shear modulus of polyurethane as [`G=[$g]`] [`MPa`], determine [`P`].
