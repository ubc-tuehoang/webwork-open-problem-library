A load is driven by an induction motor from one end of a shaft. Driving of the shaft is supplemented by a belt-drive unit, which is placed on the other side of the load. The lengths of the resulting three segments of the shaft are equal at [`l=[$l]`] [`m`]. The shaft is supported on a smooth ball bearing at the far end. The shaft has a uniform circular cross-section of radius [`[$r]`] [`cm`] and is made of homogeneous and isotropic material of shear modulus [`G=[$g]`] [`GPa`]. The torque applied by the motor is [`T_m=[$tm]`] [`Nm`] in the counter-clockwise direction looking in from left. The drive torque of the belt drive is [`T_b=[$tb]`] [`Nm`] in the clockwise direction looking from the right, as shown in the figure.

1. What is the torque [`T_i`] transmitted to the load?
2. What is the maximum shear stress in the shaft?
3. Determine the angle twist due to the torsion of the shaft:
	a. at the load loaction ([`B`]) with respect to the motor location ([`A`])
	b. at the bearing loaction ([`D`]) with respect to the load location ([`B`])

[`T_i=`] [____] [`Nm`]  
[`\tau_{max}=`] [____] [`MPa`]  
[`\phi_{B/A}=`] [____][`^{\circ}`]  
[`\phi_{D/B}=`] [____][`^{\circ}`]
