The simply supported beam in the figure has overhang of [`\frac{L}{3}=[$l/3]`] [`m`] on both sides. In addition to sections at both ends (at [`A`] and [`B`]), we have two more sections in which the bending moment is zero. Calculate the distance of those sections with respect to point [`A`] and determine the shear force magnitude at both locations. Enter your answers as a comma separated list. Assume [`q = [$q]`] [`kN/m`].
