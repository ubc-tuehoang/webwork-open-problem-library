BEGIN_TEXT
A bolt is positioned in the \(x\)-\(y\)-\(z\) coordinate system with the bolt head at the location \((1, 2, -1)\) in inches. The axis of the bolt is aligned such that the head of the bolt points towards the coordinate system origin and the threads point directly away. A wrench is fitted to the head of the bolt. Where should the free end of the wrench (the place where the hand force is applied) be located in order to maximize the torque exerted on the bolt? (Assume that the force is constant and is always applied perpendicular to the wrench.)
