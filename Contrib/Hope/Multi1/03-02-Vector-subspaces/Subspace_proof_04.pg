BEGIN_PGML
## Statement

Prove that the set of all [` n \times n `] skew-symmetric matrices with real number entries is a subspace of the vector space of all [` n \times n `] matrices with real number entries.

## Proof

Suppose [` S `] is the set of all [` n \times n `] skew-symmetric matrices with real number entries and [` V `] is the set of all [` n \times n `] matrices with real entries.

### Part 1: Show that the subset contains the zero vector

Instructions: Put the following statements in order so that they prove that the the subset [` S `] contains the zero vector of [` V `].
For uniformity, the proof assumes that you will 
state what you want to show first, 
then show the result, 
and conclude with a statement about [` S `].

### Part 2: Show that the subset is closed under addition

Instructions: Put the following statements in order so that they prove that the the subset [` S `] is closed under addition.
For uniformity, the proof assumes that you will 
state what kind of elements you're working with first, 
then state what you want to show, 
then make statements about [` A `], 
then make statements about [` B `], 
and conclude with statements about [` A + B `] and [` S `].

### Part 3: Show that the subset is closed scalar multiplication

Instructions: Put the following statements in order so that they prove that the the subset [` S `] is closed under scalar multiplication.
For uniformity, the proof assumes that you will 
state what kind of elements you're working with first, 
then state what you want to show, 
then make statements about [` A `],
and conclude with statements about [` r A `] and [` S `].

## Advice for more practice

You should use these WebWork proofs as a starting point for learning how to write proofs.  This WebWork proof will help you understand the structure of a subspace proof (how statements are ordered).  Reviewing several subspace proofs in WebWork and comparing them will help you see similarities and discern a general pattern or outline for subspace proofs.  Using these subspace proofs as a template or guide, you should transition to writing your own proofs using a "fill in the blank" approach: "Suppose for full generality that ____ ", "Show that _____ ", "Since _____ has property ___ we know ___ ", "Because of these details _____ we know ____ ", and "Since _____ we conclude that ____ ".  Then, deepen your understanding by looking at the details in each step of the WebWork proof and thinking about how you would justify each step and each equality.  Finally, after several rounds of practicing proof writing by "filling in the blanks", try writing a proof from scratch with as little help as possible.  Your goal should be to be able to write your own proof from scratch without help.  In general, memorizing proofs is not very useful; you're better off spending your time trying to understand the structural elements that go into writing a proof, understanding the details of a proof, and practicing by writing proofs and getting feedback from others who know how to write proofs.
