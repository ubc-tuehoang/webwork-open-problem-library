BEGIN_PGML
# Distance between parallel lines

Suppose you are given two parallel lines [` \mathcal{L}_1: \ \mathbf{x_1}(s) = A + s \mathbf{v} `] and [`\mathcal{L}_2: \ \mathbf{x_2}(t) = B + t \mathbf{w} `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance between these two parallel lines?
Answer by dragging statements from the left column to the right column and putting them in the correct order in the right column.
Note: your answer does not need to use all of the statements from the left column.
Hint: draw a picture.

# Distance between parallel planes

Suppose you are given two parallel planes [` \mathcal{P}_1 : n_1 (x - a_1) + n_2 (y - a_2) + n_3 (z - a_3) = 0 `] and [` \mathcal{P}_2 : m_1 (x - b_1) + m_2 (y - b_2) + m_3 (z - b_3) = 0 `].
What is a procedure you could use to find the distance between these two parallel planes?
Hint: draw a picture.
