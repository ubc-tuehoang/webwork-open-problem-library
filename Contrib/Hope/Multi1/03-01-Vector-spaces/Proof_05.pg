## Statement

Let [` V `] be any vector space.  Prove that the zero vector in [` V `] is unique.

## Proof

Instructions: Put the following statements in order so that they prove that the zero vector is unique.
For uniformity, the proof assumes that you will 
state what kind of elements you're working with first, 
then state what you want to show, 
then make statements about [` \mathbf{0} `] and what it means for [` \mathbf{0} `] to be a zero vector, 
then make statements about [` \mathbf{0'} `] and what it means for [` \mathbf{0'} `] to be a zero vector, 
and conclude with statements that show [` \mathbf{0} `] and [` \mathbf{0'} `] must be the same vector.

## Advice for more practice

You should use these WebWork proofs as a starting point for learning how to write proofs.  This WebWork proof will help you understand the structure of a subspace proof (how statements are ordered).  Reviewing several proofs in WebWork and comparing them will help you see similarities and discern a general pattern or outline for proofs.  Using these proofs as a template or guide, you should transition to writing your own proofs using a "fill in the blank" approach: "Suppose for full generality that ____ ", "Show that _____ ", "Since _____ has property ___ we know ___ ", "Because of these details _____ we know ____ ", and "Since _____ we conclude that ____ ".  Then, deepen your understanding by looking at the details in each step of the WebWork proof and thinking about how you would justify each step and each equality.  Finally, after several rounds of practicing proof writing by "filling in the blanks", try writing a proof from scratch with as little help as possible.  Your goal should be to be able to write your own proof from scratch without help.  In general, memorizing proofs is not very useful; you're better off spending your time trying to understand the structural elements that go into writing a proof, understanding the details of a proof, and practicing by writing proofs and getting feedback from others who know how to write proofs.
