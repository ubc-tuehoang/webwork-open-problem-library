## Reading questions for series

Consider the sequence [`` \lbrace a_n \rbrace = \left\lbrace \frac{1}{2^n} \right\rbrace ``].

a. The first five terms in this sequence are  [______________________]{$ans1->cmp(ordered=>1,showLengthHints => 1)}.  Enter a comma separated list of numbers (in order).

b. The first five partial sums of this sequence are [______________________]{$ans2->cmp(ordered=>1,showLengthHints => 1)}.  Enter a comma separated list of numbers (in order).

c. The sum of the first [`n`] terms of the sequence is the partial sum [`S_n = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} = `] [_________]{$ans3}.  Your answer should be in terms of [`n`].

d. The sum of all terms in the sequence is defined as the the limit of the partial sums, which means  
 
    [`` \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \bigg( ``] [____________]{$ans4} [``\bigg) = ``] [_______]{$ans5}.

e. [@ $mc1 -> print_q() @]***  
    [@ ANS( checkbox_cmp( $mc1->correct_ans() ) ); $mc1 -> print_a() @]***
