Physics problems, mostly at the first-year university level, mostly taken from the OpenStax College Physics textbook, by Urone et al. There are also some problems at the second-year level (modern physics) from various textbooks.

Make sure the file BrockPhysicsMacros.pll is included in the directory "macros". Even if this file is empty, it is needed to prevent nuisance error messages. The purpose of the file is to include any future macros that will optimize the functionality of the problems.
