# Problem Statement

BEGIN_PGML

David and his family recently installed a clothes line to dry their laundry 
during the summer months. Interested to find out how much energy the clothes 
line will save, David looks up his dryer machine online and finds the wattage 
to be [$dryerPowerW][`\text{W}`]. He estimates that his family uses the dryer 
[$numberLoads] times a week with an average cycle time of [$minutes] minutes.

# Problem One  
##########################################

Section::Begin("Part 1: Energy Saved",
    is_open => "always",);

BEGIN_PGML

Assuming that for the 12 weeks in summer (June, July, August) the clothes 
line can always be used, how much energy does David and his family save by 
*not* using the dryer? 

[__________]{$energySavedkWh}[`\text{kWh}`]

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[``[$dryerPowerW]\text{W} \cdot 
[$minutes]\text{ minutes } \cdot 
\frac{\text{1 hour}}{\text{60 minutes}} \cdot 
\frac{\text{1 kWh}}{\text{1000 Wh}} \cdot 
\frac{[$numberLoads]\text{ Cycles}}{\text{Week}} \cdot 
\text{12 Weeks} = 
[$energySavedkWh] \text{ kWh} ``]

# Problem Two  
##########################################

Section::Begin("Part 2: Reduction in Energy Use",
    can_open => "when_previous_correct",);

BEGIN_PGML

Not knowing how big of a contribution this is to his total household 
electricity use, David looks up their electricity bill from the last year. He 
finds that for *each* of the three months (June, July, August) his family 
used [$monthlyEnergyMJ][`\text{MJ}`] of energy.

Assuming David's household monthly electricity usage would have been the 
exact same as the previous year if they did not install the clothes line, how 
much energy did they save as a percentage of the total bill?

[__________]{$energySavedPercent} *%*

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[``[$monthlyEnergyMJ]\text{MJ} \cdot 
\frac{\text{1 hour}}{\text{3600 sec}} \cdot 
\frac{\text{1000 kWh}}{\text{1 MWh}} \cdot 
(\text{3 Months}) = 
[$totalEnergykWh]\text{ kWh}``]

[``(\frac{[$energySavedkWh]\text{kWh}}{[$totalEnergykWh]\text{kWh}}) \cdot 
\text{100}% = [$energySavedPercent] % ``]

END_PGML_SOLUTION

# Problem Three  
##########################################

Section::Begin("Part 3: Emission Reduction",
    can_open => "when_previous_correct",);

BEGIN_PGML

Still uncertain with how this effects actual emission levels, David wants 
to understand how much CO2 this saves from going into the atmosphere. He 
assumes that all his energy comes from a nearby gas power plant. 
Online, he find that a natural gas facility produces roughly 
[$emissions_lbPerkWh][`\frac{\text{lbs}}{\text{kWh}}`] of CO2. 

How much CO2 did David's family save from being emitted by using a clothes 
line over three months?

[__________]{$co2}[`\text{kg CO2}`]

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[``[$energySavedkWh]\text{kWh} \cdot 
[$emissions_lbPerkWh]\frac{\text{lbs}}{\text{kWh}} \cdot 
\frac{\text{1 kg}}{\text{2.204 lb}} = 
[$co2]\text{ kg of CO2}``]
