BEGIN_TEXT
Order \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof by $BBOLD contrapositive $EBOLD of the statement:
$PAR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
\( \forall x\epsilon \mathbb{Z}, $a x+$b \)  even \(\Rightarrow  x \) is odd
$EITALIC $ECENTER

\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}

END_TEXT

ANS($CorrectProof->cmp);

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the contrapositive of \(P \implies Q\) is \( \sim Q \implies \sim P\).  You need to start with \( \sim Q \) 
END_HINT

$showHint=4;
BEGIN_HINT
Start with the precise meaning of \( \sim Q \) if \( Q \) is "\( x \) is odd".  In this, you will also need to include the starting assumption regarding the domain. 
END_HINT

$showHint=10;
BEGIN_HINT
Do not skip steps.  A proof is an argument to someone else regarding the truth of a given proposition.  In particular, in many proofs a significant part of it all is tedious algebra.  You will need to use at least two  tedious algebra statements for this proof.
