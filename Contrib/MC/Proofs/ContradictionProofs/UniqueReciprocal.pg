BEGIN_TEXT
Order \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a direct proof for the existence but a proof by $BBOLD contradiction $EBOLD for uniqueness of the statement:
$PAR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
Every non-zero real number has a unique reciprocal.
$EITALIC $ECENTER

$BR

BEGIN_HINT
To start, assume you have an \(x\) with the necessary properties.
END_HINT

$showHint=4;
BEGIN_HINT
If \(x \neq 0\) then it is known that \( 1/x \) is defined and \(x \times 1/x = 1\).
END_HINT

$showHint=6;
BEGIN_HINT
To show uniqueness, you want to presume that you do not have uniqueness and then
get a contradication.  Also, be certain to determine the ending statement. That is, what would be a final concluding statement if you are trying to show that reciprocals are unique?
