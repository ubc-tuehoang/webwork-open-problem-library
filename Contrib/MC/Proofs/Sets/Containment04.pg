BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the statement
$PAR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
For any non-empty sets \($set1\) and \($set2\) with \($set2 \subsetneq $set1\), then
$PAR $PAR
 \( $set1 - $set2 = $set1 \cap $set2^c \) 
$EITALIC $ECENTER
$PAR
To show equality of these sets, one must show set containment both ways.  First, order \{ $CorrectProof1->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof of the statement:
$BR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
 \( $set1 - $set2 \subset $set1 \cap $set2^c \) 
$EITALIC $ECENTER

\{ $CorrectProof1->Print \}

For the other direction, order \{ $CorrectProof2->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof of the statement:
$BR
$BCENTER $BITALIC
 \( $set1 - $set2 \supset $set1 \cap $set2^c \) 
$EITALIC $ECENTER

\{ $CorrectProof2->Print \}

BEGIN_HINT
Often, to show two sets are equal one will show each side is contained in the other.  An alternate way used in this problem is to show first $set1 is contained in $set2 and then--by contradiction--assume there is an element of $set2 which is not in $set1.
