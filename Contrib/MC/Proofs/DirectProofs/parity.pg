BEGIN_TEXT
Order \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} of the following sentences so that they form a logical proof of the statement:
$PAR 
$BCENTER $BITALIC
If two integers have an even sum then they have the same parity.
$EITALIC $ECENTER

\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}

END_TEXT

ANS($CorrectProof->cmp);

$showHint = 4;
BEGIN_HINT
Use cases by first assuming the \($var1\) is even to show \($var2\) must also be even.  Then assume \($var1\) is odd and continue.  Normally you could do these cases in any order except for the way things are worded here requires the even case first.
