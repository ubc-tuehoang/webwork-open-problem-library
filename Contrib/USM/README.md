The impetus for creating these problems
is that I taught a summer course titled "Numbers and Secrets"
to academically talented middle- and high-school students
and couldn't find questions that quite seemed to match my needs.
There were no questions on combinatorial games at all.
I didn't find many questions on cryptography or number theory,
and while I used some, I needed a lot more, many of them easier
(even trivial, perhaps, to university professors)
but for many of them I wanted multi-part problems that build on other parts.
For instance, a problem on RSA encryption that considers various steps,
such as encoded two letters at a time, rather than one;
computing the decryption key; as well as encrypting the encoded letters.
So I wrote some.

I suppose it's possible my institution's version of the OPL was out of date,
but in any case I wrote these problems and I rather enjoyed using them.
The students also seemed to like them and they helped me debug a couple,
but fortunately most seemed to work just fine.
I submit these problems in the hope that they might prove useful to someone.
