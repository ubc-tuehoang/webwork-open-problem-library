#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
For a Physics course containing 10 students, 
the maximum point total for the quarter was 200.  
The point totals for the 10 students are given in the stem-and-leaf plot below. 
$PAR
\{ image("stemplot.gif", height=>150, width=>100, tex_size => 200) \}

$PAR
(a)   \{ $mc[$a] -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{$mc[$a] -> print_a() \}

$PAR
(b)  The lowest score in the class as a percentage of the total 
    possible points is  \{ans_rule(10)\}$PERCENT.
