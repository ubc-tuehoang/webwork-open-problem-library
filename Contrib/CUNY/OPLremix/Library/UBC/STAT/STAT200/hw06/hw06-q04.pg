BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose it is believed that the probability a patient will recover from a disease following medication is 0.9. 
A test is conducted by randomly
selecting 16 patients and observing whether they recover.

$PAR
What is the probability that 14 patients will recover? 
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).    

$PAR
Probability is  \{ ans_rule(6) \}
