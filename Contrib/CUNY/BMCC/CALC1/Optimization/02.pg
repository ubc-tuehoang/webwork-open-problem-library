BEGIN_PGML
A farmer plans to fence in a rectangular pasture adjacent to a river (see figure below). The pasture will use [$P] meters of fencing. No fencing is need along the river. 


Follow the steps below to find the length [`x`] and width [`y`] of the rectangular pasture that will enclose the greatest area.

What is the objective of the problem?

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin();
BEGIN_PGML
The objective is to maximize the rectangular area enclosed. If we represent the amount of fencing using the variable [`A`],  write a formula to compute [`A`] using [`x`] and [`y`].  This is called the primary equation.


[`A=`][____________________]{$F1}  square meters  (Primary)

BEGIN_PGML
The Pasture is constructed under a given constraint.  What is the primary factor of that given constraint?


[_]{$ans2}
END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin();
BEGIN_PGML
The constraint is a length of fencing of [$P] meters. Write an equation for the length of fencing in terms of [`x`] and [`y`]. This is called the secondary equation.


[`[$P]=`][_________________________]{$F2}  meters (secondary);
END_PGML
Section::End();

Solve the secondary equation


[``[$P]=[$F2]``]


For [`x`].


[`x=`][____________________]{$F3}
END_PGML 
Section::End();
Section::Begin();
BEGIN_PGML
Substitute [`x=[$F3]`] into the primary equation


[``A=[$F1]``]


To write the amount of fencing [`A`] as a function of [`y`].


[`A=`][____________________]{$F4} square meters
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML
For what numbers [`x`] and [`y`] is the value of [`A`] maximized.


[``A=[$F4]``] 


Length [`x`]:[_________]{$x} meters


Width [`y`]:[__________]{$y} meters
