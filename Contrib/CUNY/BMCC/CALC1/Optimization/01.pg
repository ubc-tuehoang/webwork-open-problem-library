BEGIN_PGML
A farmer plans to fence in a rectangular pasture adjacent to a river (see figure below). The pasture must contain [$A] square meters. No fencing is need along the river. 


Follow the steps below to find the length [`x`] and width [`y`] of the rectangular pasture that will require the least amount of fencing.

What is the objective of the problem?

Section::Begin();
BEGIN_PGML
The objective is to minimize the amount fencing. If we represent the amount of fencing using the variable [`P`],  write a formula to compute [`P`] using [`x`] and [`y`].  This is called the primary equation.


[`P=`][____________________]{$F1}  meters  (Primary)

BEGIN_PGML
The Contraint is an area of [$A] square meters. Write an equation for the area in terms of [`x`] and [`y`]. This is called the secondary equation.

BEGIN_PGML
Substitute [`x=[$F3]`] into the primary equation


[``P=[$F1]``]


To write the amount of fencing [`P`] as a function of [`y`].

For what numbers [`x`] and [`y`] is the value of [`P`] minimized?


[``P=[$F4]``] 


Length [`x`]:[_________]{$x} meters


Width [`y`]:[__________]{$y} meters
