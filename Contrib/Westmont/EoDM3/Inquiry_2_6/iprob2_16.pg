BEGIN_TEXT
    Is it possible to create an undirected graph with three vertices such that
    each vertex has odd degree? Describe an example, or explain why it isn't
    possible.

Answers may vary. Sample answer: You can't construct such a graph, because each edge adds 2 to the sum of the degrees, so the sum of the degrees is even. Therefore at least one of the vertices must have even degree.
