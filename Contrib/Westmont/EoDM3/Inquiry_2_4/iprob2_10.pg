BEGIN_TEXT
An $BITALIC f-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph where each vertex has outdegree 1. That
is, each vertex has exactly one arrow coming out of it. 
$PAR

An $BITALIC r-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph with no multiple edges.  That is, for
vertices \(u\), \(v\), there can be at most one edge from \(u\) to \(v\).
$PAR

On a separate sheet of paper, draw an example of an r-graph with at least five vertices that is not an
    f-graph.  Invent a shorthand notation that encodes all the information
    needed to reconstruct the graph, and describe your graph using this notation.
