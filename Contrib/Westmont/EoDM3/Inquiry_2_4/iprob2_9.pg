BEGIN_TEXT
An $BITALIC f-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph where each vertex has outdegree 1. That
is, each vertex has exactly one arrow coming out of it. 
$PAR

An $BITALIC r-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph with no multiple edges.  That is, for
vertices \(u\), \(v\), there can be at most one edge from \(u\) to \(v\).
$PAR

Is every f-graph also an r-graph? Explain.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. Sample answer:
Yes, every f-graph is an r-graph. In an f-graph, no vertex can have more than one arrow coming out of it. Therefore there cannot be any multiple edges.
