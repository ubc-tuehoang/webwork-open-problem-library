BEGIN_TEXT
For each statement below, give a list of natural numbers that satisfies the statement.
Can you find a single list that satisfies both statements?
$PAR
$BITALIC Statement p:$EITALIC There is a number in the list that is greater than every other number in the list.
$BR
$BITALIC Statement q:$EITALIC Every number in the list is less than some other number in the list.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. Sample answer: The list 1,2,3 satisfies statement p because
3 is greater than every other number in the list. The infinite list \(5, 10,
15, \ldots\) satisfies statement q, because if \(x\) is in the list, so is
\(x+5\). There can't be a list satisfying both statements, because statement p
requires there to be a maximum element, and statement q requires that no
element be the maximum.
