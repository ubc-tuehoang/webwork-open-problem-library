BEGIN_TEXT
The diagram below shows a standard brick pattern (a "running bond" pattern)
composed of two different colors of bricks. The bricklayer had certain rules in
mind governing the arrangement of the colors. Devise some possible rules,
written as logical statements. Your statements should be as specific as
possible, but should also hold true for every brick in the pattern. $PAR
