BEGIN_TEXT
    For an undirected graph \(G\), let \(c(G)\) be the number of vertices of \(G\) minus the
    number of edges of \(G\). Given a graph \(G\), suppose you form a new graph \(G'\) by adding a
    vertex to \(G\) in the middle of one of its edges, as follows.

$PAR
    Notice that \(c(G)=c(G')\). Explain why adding a vertex in this manner will
    always preserve the number of vertices minus the number of edges.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. Sample answer:
Adding a vertex in this manner will increase the number of edges by 1, since an edge gets divided in two. It will also add 1 to the number of vertices, so the number of vertices minus the number of edges will remain unchanged.
