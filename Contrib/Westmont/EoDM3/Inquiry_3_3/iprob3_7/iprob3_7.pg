BEGIN_TEXT
    Examine the figure below. Write a short paragraph giving instructions for
    drawing this figure. Your instructions should be detailed enough so that
    someone who follows them will be able to reproduce the figure. If
    possible, ask a friend who hasn't seen the figure 
    to try drawing it using your instructions.

Answers may vary. Sample answer: Start with a vertical segment 1 unit long, and draw another 1-unit-long segment perpendicular to it to form a "T". At each ends of the segment you just drew, draw a 1/2-unit-long segment to form T's. At each end of these two segments, draw 1/4-unit-long segments to form T's. Continue to form T's on the ends, halving the length each time.
