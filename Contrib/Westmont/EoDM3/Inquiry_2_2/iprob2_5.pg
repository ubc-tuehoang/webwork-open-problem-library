Consider the following collections of natural numbers.
$PAR
$BITALIC Collection T: $EITALIC All multiples of 2.
$PAR
$BITALIC Collection R: $EITALIC All multiples of 3.
$PAR
$BITALIC Collection S: $EITALIC All multiples of 5.
$PAR
    How are these collections related? Is there any overlap? Explain your
    findings in some organized way.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. Sample answer:
Collections T and R overlap in the multiples of 6, 
collections R and S overlap in the multiples of 15, 
collections T and S overlap in the multiples of 10, 
and all three collections overlap in the multples of 30.
