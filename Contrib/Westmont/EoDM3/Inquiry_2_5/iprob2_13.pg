Answers may vary. Sample answer:
No. For example, consider a tournament with three players \(A,B,C\).  Suppose player \(A\) beats player \(B\), player \(B\) beats player \(C\), and player \(C\) beats player \(A\). The each player has played every other player exactly once, but each has only one win, so there is no clear champion.
