BEGIN_TEXT
Two natural numbers are called relatively prime if they have no common
divisors, other than 1. On a separate sheet of paper, draw a diagram that shows
the natural numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and indicates which pairs of numbers are
relatively prime. Be prepared to explain how to interpret your diagram.  
$PAR
If two natural numbers are relatively prime to a third, must they be relatively
prime to each other? Prove or disprove.

\{essay_box(4,60)\}

$PAR
Separate the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 into groups such that each group consists
of numbers that are relatively prime to each other? What is the fewest number
of groups required?
$BR
Fewest number of groups = \{ans_rule(10)\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
If two numbers are relatively prime to a third, they need not be relatively
prime to each other; counterexample: 4 and 8 are both relatively prime to 7, but 4
and 8 are not relatively prime. $PAR
The fewest number of groups required is 3, since 4, 6, and 8 must be in
different groups.
