$BBOLD Definition. $EBOLD 
An $BITALIC f-graph $EITALIC is a directed graph where each vertex has outdegree 1. That is, each vertex has exactly one arrow coming out of it.  
$PAR
    An f-graph is called $BITALIC epi $EITALIC if each vertex has indegree 1. That is, each vertex has exactly one arrow pointing to it.  On a separate sheet of paper, draw an example of an epi f-graph and an example of a non-epi f-graph.  Make a conjecture about the properties of epi f-graphs.
