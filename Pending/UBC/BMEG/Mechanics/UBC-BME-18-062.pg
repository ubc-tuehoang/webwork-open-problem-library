Consider a weight lifter who is trying to lift a barbell. The forces acting on the lower part of the athlete's body and the mechanical model of the system are shown in the figures above. Point [`O`] designates the center of rotation at the joint formed by the sacrum and the fifth lumbar vertebra. [`A`] is the point of application of force exerted by the back muscles, point [`B`] is the center of gravity of the lower body, and [`C`] is the point of application of the ground reaction force. With respect to point [`O`], [`a = [$a]`] [`cm`], [`b = [$b]`] [`cm`], and [`c = [$c]`] [`cm`], are the shortest distances between the lines of action of the back ground reaction force with the center of rotation of the joint. For a weight lifter in this position, it is estimated that the force exerted by the back muscles is [`F_M = [$Fm]`] [`N`] and the line of action of this force makes an angle [`\theta = [$theta]^{\circ}`] with the vertical. If the barbell weighs [`W_0 = [$Wo]`] [`N`] and the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the lower body is [`W_1 = [$W1]`] [`N`]:

*a)* Determine the weight ([`W`]) of the athlete.

[`W=`] [_____]{"$w"} [`N`]  

*b)* Determine the magnitude of the reaction force ([`F_J`]) acting at the joint.

[`F_J=`] [_____]{"$Fj"} [`N`]  

*c)* Determine an angle [`\alpha`] that the line of action of the joint reaction force makes with the horizontal.

[`\alpha=`] [_____]{"$alpha"}[`^{\circ}`]
