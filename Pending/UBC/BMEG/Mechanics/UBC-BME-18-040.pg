BEGIN_PGML


A gymnast falls from the high bar and lands on a [`[$t]`] [`cm`] thick gymnastics mat. The gymnast strikes the back of his head against the mat during his landing. His head is moving at [`[$v]`] [`m/s`] when it first strikes the mat. The mass of his head is [`[$m]`] [`kg`]. The impact ends when the gymnast's head comes to a stop after deflecting the mat [`[$dt]`] [`cm`]. Hint: don't forget potential energy and pay attention to direction!

*a)* How much kinetic energy does the gymnast's head have at the instant just before it contacts the mat?

[`KE=`] [_____]{"$ke"} [`J`]  

*b)* How much work does the mat do to stop the motion of the gymnast's head?

[`W=`] [_____]{"$w"} [`J`]  

*c)* What average impact force does the mat exert on the gymnast's head during the impact?

[`F=`] [_____]{"$f"} [`F`]  

*d)* Estimate the peak impact force exerted by the mat on the gymnast's head. You can assume a triangular loading profile.

[`F_{peak}=`] [_____]{"$fp"} [`F`]  

*e)* Estimate the peak acceleration of the gymnast's head.

[`a_{peak}=`] [_____]{"$ap"} [`m/s^2`]  

*f)* Express this peak acceleration in g's.

[`a_{peak}=`] [_____]{"$apg"} [`g`]
