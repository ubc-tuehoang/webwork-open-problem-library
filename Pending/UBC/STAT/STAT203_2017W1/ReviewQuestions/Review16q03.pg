BEGIN_TEXT
The Department of Transport in Statcity face a problem as a large
proportion of the roads in the city are in need of repair. Local contractors
in the city are invited to submit bids for the work. One of the requirements
for a bid is that the contractor estimates the number of days it would take
their company to complete the work. In total 25 contractors submit bids, and
the estimates of days to completion are shown below in a boxplot.

 (a) The median appears to be about @ans1[0] days.

(b) The IQR appears to be about @ans2[0] days.

(c) In this case we would say values above \( @tem1[0] + 1.5 \times @tem2[0] = @ans3[0] \) are outliers.

(d) The distribution appears to be right--skewed, with a long upper
tail.
