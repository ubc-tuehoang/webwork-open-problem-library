The full question is provided on the course website. Please read them. 
$BR
Richmond condominium data.
$BR
A systematic sample of
\(n=89\) Richmond condominium properties listed on Nov 5, 2014 was obtained,
with variables: asking price, finished floor area, age of building,
number of bedrooms, monthly maintenance fee.
Similar to the in-class example, scaled variables are: 
askprice =(askingprice)/10000, ffarea=(finishedfloorarea)/100, and mfee=(maintenance fee)/10,
and the transform sqfl=sqrt(floor) was used.


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (a) $EBOLD
$BR
Which of the 3 models do you prefer, state several reasons why.
\{ $mca->print_a() \}


$BR
$BBOLD Question (b) $EBOLD
$BR
For your model of choice, assuming that the usual assumptions are
valid, obtain a 95% confidence interval for the
regression coefficient for ffarea.
$BR
Lower limit is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR
Upper limit is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (c) $EBOLD
$BR
Interpret the interval estimate in (b).


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (d) $EBOLD
$BR
For the model with 4 explanatory variables,
(ffarea, beds, sqfl, age),
the least squares estimates are different from those for the Burnaby condo data
(the example used in lectures) because [complete a sentence from one those below]
\{ $mcd->print_a() \}


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (e) $EBOLD
$BR
For another Richmond condo that was on sale on November 2014, predict the value
of the asking price
if ffarea=16, beds=3, sqfl=sqrt(6), age=8, mfee=35, 
based on your chosen model in (a).
$BR
\{ ans_rule(8) \}



$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Question (f) $EBOLD
$BR
If the values in (e) for the explanatory variables are for a Richmond condo in December 2015 (one year
later), could the regression equation be used?
Start with one of those below and complete a sentence.
$BR
- Yes because/assuming ...
$BR
- Maybe but/because ...
$BR
- No because ...

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) Model with ffarea, sqfl, age, mfee is best of the three models because it has largest adjusted R2 and smallest residual SE, and all regression coefficients are quite significant.
$BR
(b) With 84 df, the t critical value is 1.989. The SE is given as 0.7137; 1.989*.7137 = 1.420 is the margin of error. The 95% confidence interval is 3.5605+/-1.420 or 2.141 to 4.980.
$BR
(c) Based on the given data, this is the interval of the most plausible values (at 95% confidence) for the increase in asking price for one unit increase in ffarea, with values of sqfl, age, mfee held fixed.
$BR
(d) Population of properties in Burnaby and Richmond are different due to different cities, geography, characteristics etc. 
$BR
Or (but unlikely): true betas are the same but there is sampling error or variability from the small samples.
$BR
(e) betahat=c(-14.2293,3.5605,3.3682,-0.6717,0.8136); xstar=c(1,16,sqrt(6),8,35); sum(betahat*xstar)= 74.09147 which becomes 740900 after multiplying by 10000.
$BR
(f) No because of extrapolation in time (there could be inflation or deflation of housing prices within one year). 
$BR
Or (but unlikely): Yes, assuming relationship of variables and model is unchanged in one year. 
$BR
Or: Maybe, but multiply the prediction by the inflation/deflation rate over the year (that is, the most important explanatory variables are likely the same in one year, but the betas could change by a multiplicative constant).
