The drag on a sphere located in a pipe through which a fluid is flowing is to be determined experimentally. Assume that the drag is a function of the sphere diameter, the pipe diameter, the fluid velocity, and the fluid density. Some experiments using water indicate that for a sphere diameter of [`0.2`] [`in`], a pipe diameter of [`[$d]`] [`in`], and a fluid velocity of [`[$V]`] [`ft/s`], the drag is [`1.5 \cdot 10^{-3}`] [`lb`]. Estimate the drag on a sphere located in a [`2`] [`ft`] diameter pipe through which water is flowing with a velocity of [`6`] [`ft/s`]. The sphere diameter is such that geometric similarity is maintained.
