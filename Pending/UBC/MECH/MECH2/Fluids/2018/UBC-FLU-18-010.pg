BEGIN_PGML

A liquid container with diameter [`[$TankDia]`] [`m`] and height [`[$TankHeight]`] [`m`] is filled with water such that an air gap of [`[$AirGap]`] [`mm`] exists between the liquid surface and the container lid. The container was filled in a facility which is maintained at [`20^{\circ}C`] ([`\rho = 998`] [`kg/m^3`]); it is then placed inside a heating chamber and heated to [`90^{\circ}C`] ([`\rho = 965`] [`kg/m^3`]). If the container lid was not sealed properly, calculate the mass of water lost during the heating process.

[`m=`] [____]{"$Ans"} [`kg`]
