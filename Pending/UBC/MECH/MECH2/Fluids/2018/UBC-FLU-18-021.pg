A mooring system consists of an anchor which is free at one end and attached to a cable at the other end (refer to the figure above). The top end of the cable is attached to a floating barge platform. The anchor has a mass of [`[$AnchorMass]`] [`kg`], a volume of [`[$AnchorVolume]`] [`m^3`], total end-to-end length [`L_A = [$AnchorLength]`] [`m`], and its center of mass is located a distance [`L_G = [$AnchorCGLength]`] [`m`] from the free end. The anchor's hydrostatic center is located at its center of mass. The cable is of length [`L_C = [$CableLength]`] [`m`], has a mass-per-unit-length in water of [`108`] [`kg/m`]. The barge platform has a mass of [`[$BargeMass]`] [`kg`] and may be modelled as a cylinder with diameter [`D_B = [$BargeDia]`] [`m`] and length [`L_B = [$BargeLength]`] [`m`]. The ocean depth at this location is [`h = [$Depth]`] [`m`]. After a long time, the anchor finally settles at the position shown in the figure below. Assuming no wind, wave, or current, determine the settling position of the barge relative to the anchor base (denoted by [`x`] in the figure below). The density of ocean water is [`1025`] [`kg/m^3`].
