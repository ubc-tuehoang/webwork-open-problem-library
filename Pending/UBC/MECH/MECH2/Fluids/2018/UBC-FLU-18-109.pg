The automated syringe shown in the figure must deliver medicinal fluid at a velocity of [`V_e = [$AvgVel2]`] [`m/s`]. The diameter of the first syringe segment is [`D_1 = 0.5`] [`in`], and that of the second segment is [`D_2 = 0.0625`] [`in`]. the flow resistance coefficient for the reducing portion is [`K = 3`]. The length of the second segment is [`L_2 = [$TubeLength2Tmp]`] [`cm`]. Determine the force pushing the piston [`F_p`] when [`L_1 = [$TubeLength1Tmp]`] [`cm`]. The density and viscosity of the medicinal fluid are [`1200`] [`kg/m3`] and [`0.025`] [`Pa\cdot s`].

[`F_p=`] [_____]{"$Ans"} [`N`]

_Notes: Assume that the fluid is perfectly incompressible. The flow resistance coefficient given for the reducing portion applies to the fluid velocity in the first segment of the syringe_.
