You have been hired to design an experimental setup that will be used for testing the effect of low speed laminar water flow on biological materials. The basic idea of the setup is shown in Figure [`1`]. A thin strip of biological material, with length [`L = [$StripLengthTmp]`] [`cm`] and width [`W = [$StripWidthTmp]`] [`cm`], will be attached to the end of a slender rod of height [`H = [$RodHeightTmp]`] [`cm`], much like a flag attached to a flagpole. The setup will then be subjected to water flow at velocities ranging from [`U_0 = 0.1`] [`m/s`] to [`U_0 = [$FlowSpeed]`] [`m/s`]. In order to minimize the effects of the rod on the flow, it is a requirement that the rod be as thin as possible.

The experimenters are also interested in studying the effects of water temperature; they will therefore be varying the water temperature from [`4`] to [`90^{\circ}C`] over the course of their experiments. The properties of water will vary significantly over this range. In order to estimate the viscosity of water, you decide to make use of the following well-known approximation:

>>[``ln\frac{\mu}{\mu_0}\approx a + b\bigg(\frac{T_0}{T}\bigg)+c\bigg(\frac{T_0}{T}\bigg)^2``]<<

Where [`\mu_0=0.001792`] [`Pa\cdot s`], [`T_0=273.16 K`], [`a=-1.94`], [`b=-4.80`], and [`c=6.74`], [`T`] is the fluid temperature in Kelvin, and [`\mu`] is the fluid viscosity.

In order to estimate the density of water, you access tabulated values for water density as a function of temperature, then use a curve fit to generate the following cubic expression:

>>[``\rho=\alpha T^3 + \beta T^2 + \gamma T + \zeta``]<<

Where [`\alpha=0.0000162925`], [`\beta=-0.0192687797`], [`\gamma=6.8946224628`], [`\zeta=222.4454582287`], [`T`] is the fluid temperature in Kelvin, and [`\rho`] is the fluid density.

You skip ahead a few chapters in your fluid mechanics textbook and find that the velocity profile near a flat surface for laminar flow may be approximated by the following expression:

>>[``\frac{u(x,y)}{U_0}=\frac{2y}{\delta (x)} - \bigg(\frac{y}{\delta (x)}\bigg)^2``]<<

Where [`u(x,y)`] is the local flow velocity parallel to the surface, [`x`] is the distance downstream from the slender rod, [`y`] is the perpendicular distance away from the flat surface (see Figure [`2`]), and [`\delta (x)`] is defined as:

>>[``\delta (x) = 5.0 \bigg(\frac{\mu x}{\rho U_0}\bigg)^{1/2}``]<<

Using all of the information at your disposal, determine the appropriate diameter of the rod if the bending strength of the rod material is [`[$BendingStrengthTmp]`] [`MPa`]. Ignore the weights of the rod and strip, as well as the drag force acting on the rod. In order to account for these omissions, apply a safety factor of [`[$SafetyFactor]`].

The bending stress at the rod base is defined as follows:

>>[``\sigma_B = \frac{32M}{\pi D^2}``]<<

Where [`M`] is the bending moment applied at the rod base, and [`D`] is the rod diameter.
