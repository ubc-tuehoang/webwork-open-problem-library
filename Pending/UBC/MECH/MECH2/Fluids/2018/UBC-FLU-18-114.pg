BEGIN_PGML

At flight speed, a small aircraft has a lift coefficient of [`[$LiftCoeff]`] and a drag coefficient of [`[$DragCoeff]`]. If the aircraft weights [`[$PlaneMass]`] [`kg`], determine the thrust necessary for steady horizontal flight. The density of air at the altitude flown by this aircraft is [`1.15`] [`kg/m^3`] and the overall effective planform area of the aircraft is [`12`] [`m^2`].

[`F_T=`] [____]{"$Ans"} [`kN`]
