A large, rigid, rectangular billboard is supported by an elastic column as shown in Figure. There is concern about the deflection, [`\delta`], of the top of the structure during a high wind of velocity [`V`]. A wind tunnel test is to be conducted with a [`1 : [$Scale]`] scale model. Assume the pertinent column variables are its length and cross-sectional dimensions, and the modulus of elasticity of the material used for the column. Also assume that the same structural materials are used for the model and prototype, and the wind tunnel operates under standard atmospheric conditions. The only important "wind" variables are air density and velocity. 
1. Find the deflection of the prototype if the deflection of the model is [`1`] [`cm`].  
2. What is the required wind tunnel velocity to match a [`[$V]`] [`km/hr`] wind?

[`\delta=`] [____]{"$Ansa"} [`cm`]  
[`U=`] [____]{"$Ansb"} [`km/hr`]
