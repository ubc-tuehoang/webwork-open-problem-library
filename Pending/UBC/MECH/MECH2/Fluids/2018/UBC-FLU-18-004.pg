BEGIN_PGML

A cylindrical test tube with an inner diameter of [`[$InnerDiaTmp]`] [`mm`] and height [`[$HeightTmp]`] [`cm`] is filled to the brim with a heated liquid. As time passes, higher temperature fluid rises toward the liquid surfaces, while lower temperature fluid sinks toward the bottom of the vial; this process is referred to as thermal stratification. At some point, the liquid temperature within the vial linearly increases from [`20^{\circ}C`] at the bottom of the vial, to [`[$HighTempTmp]^{\circ}C`] at the liquid surface. The density of this particular liquid is a linear function of temperature. Its specific gravity varies from [`[$LowSG]`] at [`20^{\circ}C`] to [`[$HighSG]`] at [`[$HighTempTmp]^{\circ}C`].

Determine the mass of the liquid.
