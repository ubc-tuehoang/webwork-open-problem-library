BEGIN_PGML

A tank with diameter [`[$TankDia]`] [`m`] is filled with [`[$WaterHeight]`] [`m`] of water at a facility that is maintained at [`20^{\circ}C`]. Due to an accident, contents from other containers spill into the water tank. By accounting for mass losses, you determine that [`[$KeroseneMass]`] [`kg`] of kerosene, [`[$MercuryMass]`] [`kg`] of mercury, and an unknown amount of a third unknown substance spilled into the tank. In order to properly discard the waste, you must identify the final substance; determining its density is a good start. After some time has passed, you notice that no mixing has occurred between any of the liquids; in other words, four distinct layers of liquid are clearly visible. You measure the height of the layer containing the unknown substance to be [`[$LayerHeight]`] [`m`]. You also measure the gage pressure at the bottom of the tank to be [`[$BottomPressureTmp]`] [`kPa`]. Using this information, determine the density of the unidentified liquid.

_Hint: This problem may be easily solved without using the densities of kerosene and mercury_.

[`\rho=`] [____]{"$Ans"} [`kg/m^3`]
