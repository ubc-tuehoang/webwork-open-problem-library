BEGIN_PGML

A [`4`] [`ft`] long wind tunnel with a [`20x20`] [`in`] cross section has a maximum speed of [`145`] [`ft/s`]. A prototype is [`[$A]`] [`ft`] long, [`[$B]`] [`ft`] wide, and [`[$C]`] [`ft`] high. Assume air has a density of [`0.07350`] [`lbm/ft^3`] and viscosity of [`1.248\times10^{-5}`] [`lbm/ft\cdot s`].
1. Determine the size of the biggest model that can be made based on the rule of thumb guideline for blockage.
2. What's the maximum Reyold's number that can be achieved under these conditions?

[`Size=`] [_____]{"$l"}x[_____]{"$w"}x[_____]{"$h"} [`in`]  
[`Re=`] [_____]{"$re"}
