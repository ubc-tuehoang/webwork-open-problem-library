BEGIN_PGML
During major windstorms, high vehicles such as RVs and semis may be thrown off the road and boxcars off their tracks, especially when they are empty and in open areas. Consider a semi that weighs [`[$a]`] [`kg`] empty, is [`10`] [`m`] long, [`2.5`] [`m`] high, and [`2`] [`m`] wide. The distance between the bottom of the truck and the road is [`0.75`] [`m`]. Now the truck is exposed to winds from its side surface. Determine the wind velocity in [`m/s`] that will tip the truck over to its side. Take the air density to be [`1.25`] [`kg/m^3`] and assume the weight to be uniformly distributed. Model the truck as a rectangular plate.

Wind velocity = [____________________]{$b} [`m/s`]
