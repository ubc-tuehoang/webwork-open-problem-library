BEGIN_PGML
Your classmate drives a car with a decorative ball on the car antenna. The frontal area of the ball is [`[$a]`] [`m^2`].  As gas prices rise, they are concerned that the extra drag of the ball is wasting money.  Assuming that the drag coefficient of the ball is [`0.2`] (based on frontal area), estimate how many liters of fuel they waste per year due to the drag of the ball.  Additional information:  They drive [`[$b]`] [`km/yr`], at an average speed of [`[$c]`] [`km/hr`]. The overall car efficiency is [`[$d]`], the density of the fuel is [`[$e]`] [`kg/litre`], and the heating value of fuel is [`44,020`] [`kJ/kg`].  Air density in their region averages [`1.25`] [`kg/m3`].
