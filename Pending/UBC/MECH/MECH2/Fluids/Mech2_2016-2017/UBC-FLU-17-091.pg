BEGIN_PGML
The drag coefficient of a car at the design conditions of [`1`] [`atm`], [`25`] [`C`], and [`[$a]`] [`km/h`] is to be determined experimentally in a large wind tunnel in a full-scale test. The height and width of the car are [`[$b]`] [`m`] and [`[$c]`] [`m`], respectively. If the horizontal force acting on the car is measured to be [`[$d]`] [`N`], determine the total drag coefficient of this car. 


Total Drag Coefficient = [_______]{$e}
