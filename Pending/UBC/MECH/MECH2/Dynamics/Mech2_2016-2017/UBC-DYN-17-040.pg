BEGIN_PGML
An elevator system has a secondary safety cable in case the primary cable fails. The secondary cable is [`[$h]m`] longer than the primary cable (ie. if the primary cable fails, the elevator will experience [`[$h]m`] of free fall before the secondary cable engages). What should be the value of [`EA`] such that maximum force on the safety cable does not exceed [`[$F]kN`]? The elevator system has the following specifications: car maximum mass [`[$m]kg`] and primary cable length ranges from [`[$L]m`] to [`60m`]. Assume the primary cable failure occurs when the car is stationary. Hint: use the equation for maximum rope force derived in the lab write-up and consider which cable length maximizes the force. 

[`EA`] = [__________]{$EA} [`N`]
