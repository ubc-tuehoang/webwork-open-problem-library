While carrying out similar measurements to those you will make on the water, two kayakers measured the following: When the single kayak was towed by the double kayak at a speed of \(1.3\) \(m/s\), the towline force was \(7.0\) \(N\). When the single kayak was towed at a speed of \(2.3\) \(m/s\), the towline force was \(35\) \(N\). Assuming a simple model where \(F = KV^n\) where \(F\) is the towline force (equal to drag in this case), \(V\) is the velocity, and \(K\) and \(n\) are constants, find \(K\).
$PAR
\(K\) = \{ ans_rule(10) \}
