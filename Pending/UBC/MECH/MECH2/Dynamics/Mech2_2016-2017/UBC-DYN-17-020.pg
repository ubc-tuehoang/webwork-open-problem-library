In the following picture, a uniform slender bar with a length of \($L\) \(m\) and mass of \($Mass\) \(kg\) is falling down transitionally (no angular velocity). Exactly before the bar strikes the ground with one of its end  (\(A\)), the bar has the velocity of \(V_1\). Calculate the following parameters in the condition that the bar rotates around the step and stop in the vertical position:$BR

$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1. Mass moment of inertia around the point \(A\), \(I_A\) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 2. Change in potential energy \(U\) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 3. Angular velocity of the bar after the strike \(\omega\) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 4. The velocity of the bar just before impacting the ground, \(V_1\)$BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 5. The velocity of the bar exactly before striking the ground if the mass of the bar is \($Mass2\) \(kg\) instead$PAR
