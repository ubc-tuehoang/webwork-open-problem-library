A nonlinear spring is attached to a block of mass with [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`]. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the ground is [`\mu_S = 0.25`] and [`\mu_K = 0.20`], respectively. The neutral position of the spring is at [`x = 0`] and the relation between the spring force and deflection is: [`F = 5x - 100x^3`] ([`F`] in [`kN`] and [`x`] in [`m`]). If the spring is stretched to [`[$dx]`] [`m`] and then released, calculate the velocity of the block of mass when [`x = 0`].
