BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that a wing component on an aircraft is fabricated from an aluminum alloy that has a plane strain fracture toughness of \($K\) \(MPa\) \(m^{1/2}\). It has been determined that the fracture results at a stress of \($stress\) \(MPa\) when the maximum internal crack length is \(8.6\) \(mm\). For this same component and alloy, compute the stress level at which fracture will occur for a critical internal crack length of \($a\) \(mm\). 

$PAR

\(\sigma=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(MPa\)
