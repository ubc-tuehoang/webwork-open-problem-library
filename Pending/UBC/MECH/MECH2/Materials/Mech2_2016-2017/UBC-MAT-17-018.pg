BEGIN_TEXT

Two previously un-deformed cylindrical specimens of an alloy are to be strain hardened by reducing their cross-sectional areas (while maintaining their circular cross sections). For one specimen the initial and deformed radii are \($r1o\) \(mm\) and \($r1d\) \(mm\) respectively. The second specimen, with an initial radius of \($r2o\) \(mm\), must have the same deformed hardness as the first specimen. Compute the second specimen's radius after deformation. $PAR\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(mm\) $BR
