BEGIN_TEXT
A test is carried out with two cylindrical specimens \(7\) \(mm\) in diameter. The first specimen has an elastic modulus of \(105\) \(GPa\) and the second has an elastic modulus of \(250\) \(GPa\). If the first specimen is subjected to \(5.6\) \(kN\) axial load, determine the load required for the second specimen in order to achieve equal strain in both of them.
