BEGIN_PGML

Liquid water at [`P = 200\,\text{kPa}`] is heated isobarically from [`T = 20\,^\circ\text{C}`] to [`T = 200\,^\circ\text{C}`]. Your task is to decide how this process should be illustrated on a [`T`]-[`v`] (*Temperature*-Specific Volume) diagram. The diagram is not intended to be to scale, but the relative positioning of points should be correct (e.g. points of high [`v`] should fall to the right of points of lower [`v`]). Several candidate process lines are illustrated below.
