BEGIN_TEXT
The figure shows an RC circuit with a voltage source as its input, and with two switches to connect and disconnect the voltage. Both switches are initially open. The switch \(1\) is then closed at time \(t = 0\), connecting the battery to the RC circuit, while switch \(2\) remains open. After a very long time, what is the voltage across the resistor?
