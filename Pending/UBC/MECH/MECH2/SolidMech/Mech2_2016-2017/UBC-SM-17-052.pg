BEGIN_TEXT

A cylindrical tank of outside diameter \(D = $D\) inches, and height \(H = $H\) inches, is made from sheet steel thickness \(t = $t\) inches. A single strain gage is attached to the middle area of the tank, inclined at an angle of \(18\) degrees to the circumference. When the tank is pressurized, the strain gage reads \(\epsilon = $epsilon \times 10^{-6}\). What is the pressure in the tank? For steel, \(E = 29 \times 10^6\) \(psi\), \(v = 0.3\). Give the answer in \(psi\).
