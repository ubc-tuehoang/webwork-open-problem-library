BEGIN_TEXT

Now imagine that a student weighing \($T\) \(N\) is performing the experiment and is suspended by the rope. Assume that the coefficient of friction \(\mu\) is approximately \($u\). The belayer is initially directly underneath the top carabiner but steps backwards a little such that the rope contact angle with the carabiner is reduced by \($c%\). What is the percentage change in minimum belayer weight required as the belayer steps backwards? give your response as the change in percent but do not use the % sign.
