Forces [`P=[$p]`] [`N`] are applied by hand to the handles of a pair of pipe pliers ([`L=[$l]`]). A pipe is held by the jaws of the pliers through this applied force. The area of X-section of the jaw segment of the pliers, near the point of pipe contact, is [`A=[$area]`] [`cm^2`]. Some relevant dimensions are shown in the figure. Determine:
1. The holding force applied [`R`] to the pipe  
2. The average shear stress on a section of the jaw just to the right of the contact point with the pipe and parallel to the direction of the pipe reaction [`R`] 
3. The loading on a section of the jaw just to left of the contact point with the pipe and parallel to the direction of [`R`]
