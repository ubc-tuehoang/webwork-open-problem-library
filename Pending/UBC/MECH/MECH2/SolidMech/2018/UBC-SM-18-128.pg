A beam [`ABC`] is supported at points [`A`] and [`B`] and subjected to load of [`q = [$q]`] [`kN/m`] throughout its length of [`[$a+$b]`] [`m`] ([`a=[$a]`] [`m`], [`b = [$b]`] [`m`]). The beam cross-section is shown in the figure. The moment of inertia about the neutral axis is equal to [`210`] [`cm^4`].
1. 	Calculate the maximum tensile stress [`\sigma_t`], and maximum compressive stress [`\sigma_c`].
2. 	We want to change the distance between supports to have the ratio of larger to smaller compressive stress being equal to the ratio of larger to smaller tensile stress for the beam. Find required distance [`a`] that results. Assume that the total length [`L = a + b = [$a+$b]`] [`m`] remains constant.

[`\sigma_t=`] [_____]{"$sigmat"} [`MPa`]  
[`\sigma_c=`] [_____]{"$sigmac"} [`MPa`]  
[`a=`] [_____]{"$anew"} [`m`]
