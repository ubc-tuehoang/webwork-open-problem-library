A schematic diagram of a steel anchoring cable of a rigid/fixed sail post at Canada Place is shown in the figure. The cable is firmly attached to the top of the sail post at one end. The other end of the cable has a rigid end cap, the position of which may be adjusted by means of a tensioning device. The tensioning device has an identical pair of steel bolts with nuts, and is rigidly attached to a fixed support base. The bolts pass through the two holes in the end cap of the cable, and the cross sectional areas for both the bolt and cable are identical. Tensioning is done by tightening the two bolts by equal amounts. Assume the following conditions:  
	Length of the cable: [`L=[$L]`] [`m`]  
	Length of each bolt: [`L/10 = [$L/10]`] [`m`]  
	Screw pitch of each nut: [`[$p]`] [`mm`]  
	Young's modulus of the bolt and cable: [`E=[$E]`] [`GPA`]  

If both nuts are tightened through [`[$n]`] turns each, in the same direction, determine the tensile stresses in both the cable and bolts.

[`\sigma_{cable}=`] [____]{$cable} [`MPa`]  
[`\sigma_{bolt}=`] [____]{$bolt} [`MPa`]
