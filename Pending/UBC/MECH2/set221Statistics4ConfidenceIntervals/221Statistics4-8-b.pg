BEGIN_TEXT
		
An engine manufacturer wants to make sure that the power output of engines coming off a production line differ by no more than \(\pm\)\($C\) HP with 95% confidence. The target power output is 150 HP. If [n] engines are tested at random, what is the largest sample standard deviation (in HP) that would be permitted if the engines are to remain within specification?
