*WARNING: Because this problem is/contains multiple choice, you are permitted A LIMITED NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS.  Use them wisely.*

In the RGB color model, which of the following two vectors would cause a display to emit more light?

[`\langle [$r1],[$g1],[$b1] \rangle \hspace{1in}
  \langle [$r2],[$g2],[$b2] \rangle`]

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'The vector on the left emits much more light',
  'The vector on the left emits slightly more light',
  'The vector on the right emits slightly more light',
  'The vector on the right emits much more light',
) ], 'The vector on the right emits slightly more light' )}

Human perception of brightness is correlated to a quantity called luminance, not discussed in Chaper 8 of the text.  One typical formula for the luminance of an RGB color vector [`\langle r,g,b \rangle`] is [`0.2126r + 0.7153g + 0.0721b`]. Compute the luminance of each RGB color vector above.

Luminance of [`\langle [$r1],[$g1],[$b1] \rangle=`][________]{$lum1}

Luminance of [`\langle [$r2],[$g2],[$b2] \rangle=`][________]{$lum2}

Which of the two would probably therefore be perceived as brighter?

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'The left vector would be perceived as slightly brighter',
  'The right vector would be perceived as slightly brighter',
) ], $ans )}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The total light emitted of the right vector is more, but not by much:

Left: [`[$r1]+[$g1]+[$b1]=[$r1+$g1+$b1]`]

Right: [`[$r2]+[$g2]+[$b2]=[$r2+$g2+$b2]`] (slightly more)

The luminance of the left vector is:

[`0.2126([$r1]) + 0.7153([$g1]) + 0.0721([$b1]) = [$lum1]`]

The luminance of the right vector is:

[`0.2126([$r2]) + 0.7153([$g2]) + 0.0721([$b2]) = [$lum2]`]

Therefore: [$ans]
