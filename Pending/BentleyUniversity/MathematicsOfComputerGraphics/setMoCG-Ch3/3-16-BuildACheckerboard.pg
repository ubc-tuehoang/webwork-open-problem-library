TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Consider a standard checkerboard (or chessboard), constructed of alternating light and dark tiles, eight tiles per side. Assume that you have two images, one of the light tile and one of the dark tile, and that each is a 1-unit-by-1-unit square with its lower left corner on the origin. Describe the set of transformations you would use to create the checkerboard from copies of them. You do not need to write all 64 transformations if you can describe the set more succinctly.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Assume the light tile is called [`L`] and the dark tile is called [`D`].
Then for the even numbers [`n = 0, 2, 4, 6`], we would create rows that begin with light tiles and end with dark tiles,

[`T_{0,n}L, ~T_{1,n}D, ~T_{2,n}L, ~T_{3,n}D, ~T_{4,n}L, ~T_{5,n}D, ~T_{6,n}L, ~T_{7,n}D.`]

For the odd numbers [`n = 1, 3, 5, 7`], we would create rows that begin with light tiles and end with dark tiles, by taking
the transformations above and interchanging the [`L`]s and [`D`]s.

[`T_{0,n}D, ~T_{1,n}L, ~T_{2,n}D, ~T_{3,n}L, ~T_{4,n}D, ~T_{5,n}L, ~T_{6,n}D, ~T_{7,n}L.`]
