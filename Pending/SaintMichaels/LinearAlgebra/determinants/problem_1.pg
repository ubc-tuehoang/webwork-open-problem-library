@c = (0,0,0);

#Generate random matrix

    $b[$count] = random(-9,9,1);
    $c[$count] = random(-9,9,1);
    $count += 1;
} until ($count == $dim);

                    [$b[2]]]);

# ANSWER AND SOLUTION

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Recall that for a region defined by the vectors \( u, v, w \), the volume of
that region is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix with those
vectors as column vectors.
$PAR
Hence, using our given vectors as column vectors, we obtain the matrix
$PAR
\( $A_matrix \)
$PAR
Now, compute the determinant
$PAR
\(
    \det $A_matrix = ($a[0])($b[1])($c[2]) +
                     ($b[0])($c[1])($a[2]) +
                     ($c[0])($a[1])($b[2]) -
                     ($b[2])($c[1])($a[0]) -
                     ($c[2])($a[1])($b[0]) -
                     ($a[2])($b[1])($c[0])
    = $DET
\)
$PAR
Then, \( \mid$DET \mid = $SOLUTION  \)
